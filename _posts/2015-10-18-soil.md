## SOIL

SOIL is an Ethereum-platform based cryptographic smart contract information and user-created application service, built directly on top of a viable digital currency. 

It will be a consensus-driven and community-managed currency, with a democratically-realized stakeholder input towards further evolution of the system and its applications.

Through the use of the decentralized blockchain, there will be no single individual or small group of individuals with control of the currency, the overall decision making will be achieved through consultation of fair voting by the people who invest in it. The maturation of the system, with a progression of the core devopment can be suggested, voted upon and acted upon by a fair consensus of the community which remains involved with the project, in a transparent and open process.

At it's heart will be **SOIL**, a currency that will be traded as any other digital currency, on major altcoin exchanges online, and on top of this currency will be a decentralized user-created application platform ensuring a global network of computers handling the simple or complex automative needs of a growing industry.

**SOIL** will focus the delivery of smart contracts to a specific sector of industry, thus building a trusted brand. **SOIL** will approach the ecological and agricultural stratum of the commercial world, bridging the gap between cryptocurrency and real-world applications of a progressively automated business sector.

Farmers and ranchers worldwide are migrating towards precision agricultural methods, creating efficiency and efficacy for agricultural inputs and the spatial and temporal management of agricultural systems. [url=http://www.researchmoz.us/]ResearchMoz [/url]has predicted that the agricultural autonomous project market will grow from $817 million from 2013 to a staggering $16.3 BILLION by 2020.

Modern farms are increasingly taking advantage of automated harvesting and tractors, which can operate around the clock and ensure tight operational windows can be achieved, especially for seeding and other time-sensitive activities. Nursery operations rely on automation for planting, pruning, grafting, etc. Weeding and thinning operations are now more and more automated. Crop inspection, data collection and manipulation are controlled by centralized computers to increase the productivity of modern farms. Dairy and poultry farms rely on heavily automated controls to work with their flocks and herds. Unmanned drones are used to inspect crops, sending data back to a centralized hub to be sorted into data and real-time 3D maps
the farmer can use to adjust his operations and produces previously unknown adaptability.

Many of these processes are controlled by centralized servers which are subject to real world hardware failures which cost productivity and affect the bottom line.

By placing these applications in a cryptographically secure and globally decentralized environment, this will remove another risk factor facing the agricultural business, and will, as the system evolves, exponentially increase the base value of **SOIL**, both as a speculative currency and as a platform for automated agricultural practices.

By being the first cryptocurrency based application to tackle these problems, we will be at the forefront of a revolution in both the altcoin world but in a future for real world applications in a automatic ecological and agricultural industry.

### Testnet setup for Ubuntu 14.04

    apt-get update
    apt-get dist-upgrade
    apt-get install git binutils bison gcc make libgmp3-dev build-essential
    bash < <(curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moovweb/gvm/master/binscripts/gvm-installer)
    echo "[[ -s \"$HOME/.gvm/scripts/gvm\" ]] && source \"$HOME/.gvm/scripts/gvm\"" >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    gvm install go1.4
    gvm use go1.4 --default
    git clone https://github.com/soilcurrency/go-ethereum.git
    cd go-ethereum
    make gsoil


Create your account:

    build/bin/gsoil account new


Boostrap - load the genesis file:

    build/bin/gsoil --genesis test-net-genesis.json

(wait a few seconds - then use ctrc+c to interrupt)

Start the client:

    build/bin/gsoil --rpc console

Start mining on our testnet:

    miner.start()
    miner.stop()

To increase the number of threads used for mining: ``miner.start(amount of threads)`` i.e.

    miner.start(4)

### Testnet setup for Windows x64

If you never have started gsoil before:

1. Extract the package (e.g. to Desktop: ``C:\Users\username\Desktop\soil_win_x64_v5_alpha``)
2. Doubleclick “new_account.bat” - Set a password. The window should be closing automatically.
3. Doubleclick “genesis.bat”. Wait a few seconds and close the window.
4. Doubleclick “soil.bat” - wait until sync.
5. Doubleclick “SOILsafe.bat” for Gui Wallet

Old hand:

1. Doubleclick “soil.bat”
2. Doubleclick “SOILsafe.bat”

Hooray, we are connected to the testnet! Now you can start to mine on our testnet:

    miner.start()
    miner.stop()

GPU mining:

1. Doubleclick “gpu_mining_solo.bat”
