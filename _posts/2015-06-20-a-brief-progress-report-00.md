# A brief progress report.

Wrestling with the charting code, I noticed that qcustomplot had been upgraded earlier this year and had gained a couple of finance-oriented chart widgets: a Candlestick widget and an OHLC widget. After brief experimentation, I chose the OHLC widget:

and the horizontal slider bar reveals the Order Depth chart:

Updated code committed to [vcoincore.features.prerelease repos](https://github.com/gjhiggins/vcoincore/tree/vcoin.feature.prerelease)

Cheers
