# An initial short progress report.


I have successfully upgraded VCoin as a fork of ZetaCoin 0.9.2. This basically involved re-re-branding Zetacoin as VCoin and transcribing the relevant parameter setting and variable bindings. 

VCoin 0.9.2 is an upgrade, just download and use.

Testnet has been enabled.

The UI has been augmented slightly via the adaptation of existing code; an in-wallet block & tx explorer, an IRC chat window and a mining page (needs work). In development is a couple of Bittrex^WBleutrade-specific tabs, a trading page and a market stats presentation, both driven by Bleutrade's almost-JSON API.

When I'm done, I'll push the code up to github.


Cheers

Graham
