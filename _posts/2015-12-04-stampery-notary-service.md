Contextual intel from [ibtimes, 2015-12-04](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/lawyers-lives-being-made-easier-thanks-stampery-bitcoin-blockchain-1531871) ...

> Blockchain notarisation provider Stampery says one of its main user groups is lawyers dealing in sensitive documents. Stampery, released to the public barely a month ago, uses the Bitcoin blockchain to generate an immutable record of existence, integrity and ownership for any set of data - files, documents, pictures and emails.
> 
> Daniele Levi, CEO of Stampery, told IBTimes UK that there were three types of users emerging – lawyers looking to certify documents, creatives using it to establish rights ownership and businesses generating prior art of their intellectual property.
> 
> Stampery is based in San Francisco, and the tech team is located in Madrid. The company launched its beta in May 2015, and then released the product to the public on 22 September at Techcrunch Disrupt SF Battlefield in San Francisco. This year the company closed seed round funding from Draper Associates with Boost VC, Blockchain Capital and Di-Ann Eisnor participating as an angel investor.
>
> Since launching Stampery has accrued about 1000 users, which is growing at a rapid clip. The service is free to users who notarise less than 10 items per month and thereafter is priced at $9.90 up to 1000 items per month.

And the $64K question on paid usage is: “What’s the frequency, Kenneth?”
