# A short report on progress

[jc12345](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=258091) suggests ...

> I would still recommend that the work on 0.10+ should continue and that the differentiating factor of vcoin is its closeness to Bitcoin providing traceability to the Bitcoin core and compatibility with Bitcoin value added services, but with enhanced specs like the quicker block time and so on.

Just too keep folks in the loop, I PM'd jc12345 with thanks for the comment, insights, kind words and indicated that I shared the above viewpoint.

Ever keen not to shut off opportunities to contribute hash to the rate, I decanted the 0.8 getwork code into a separate branch, haven't had time even to assess the amount of effort likely to be involved in re-integrating the approach to the 0.11 structure (assuming that the 0.11 structure isn't now basically inimical to the principles underpinning the getwork approach).

I have strong reasons to believe that the folks who have developed a fancy for following the monthly P&D Sheeplechase Trophy will take a while to cotton on to the fact that newly-launched 0.8.x clones are basically using obsolete code and represent a poor offer to put before P&D punters, let alone any hypothetical genuine investors.

Anyway, in lieu of anything coherent w.r.t. to progress, this is my current reading/working focus:

et. al.

I dunno, if this stuff really was as good as it’s made out to be, I’d have thought there’d be a *lot* more fuss over it.

Cheers
