## Bonafide

> Bitcoin reputation startup Bonafide ceased operations in November, less than one year after receiving funding $850,000 from investors including Blockchain Capital and Quest Venture Partners.
> 

> The startup offered an API that provided reputation data to bitcoin firms offering exchange, wallet and other consumer services.
> 

> Co-founders Karthik Balasubramanian and Brian Moyer stated their belief that the movement of investor interest away from consumer-facing applications for the technology was one factor in their demise.
> 

> Declines in consumer bitcoin spending were also cited as a factor in the shut down.

## Yacuna

> European exchange Yacuna made an orderly retreat from trading in November after a relatively short time in the cryptocurrency space. In an email to customers it informed them of the closure and advised customers to withdraw all funds.

> Talking about the closure, executive director and chief compliance officer Mark Caruso told CoinDesk:

> >"We offered the service for free since we believe in the disruptive potential of blockchain technology. However, the lack of significant volume and a growth rate that remained below expectations led to the decision of shutting down the service."
