### Expanse Development Core
The Expanse Development Core is composed of the project's founders and core developers. Knowledgeable, talented individuals with  diverse technical experience related to blockchain technology.

*People are invited to join in the beta effort to test the system and the launch effort to secure the blockchain but are excluded from ‘founder’ status.*

### Expanse Community Collective
The Expanse Community Collective is the soul of the project: the people that use it. It is made of the current active expanse token holders. Every one whole expanse counts as a voting share. Holdings less than 1 Exp do not apply.

*Voting system unspecified. Unstated core assumption: users === holders*

*“Unlike other projects the future of Expanse is chosen by contributors, miners, traders, and those that just want to be a part of and shape the future in a fair and decentralized manner.” --- just as long they hold at least one unit of the coin. Very forward-loooking.*

### Expanse Advisory Board
A third party board composed of individuals mutually elected by the Developer Core and Community Collective. These should be trusted well known members of the bitcoin/cryptocurrency community with long established reputations in good standing. Ideally, individuals that have a strong technical background and an understanding of blockchain technology, able to make well informed votes on technical and financial issues. 

*Ungrounded, undefined, unworkable: “**should** be”, “trusted”, “well known”, “long established”, “reputation”, “good standing”, “strong technical background”, “well informed”, “technical and financial issues”*

## Expanse Core Team
The Expanse Team consists of qualified, experienced, professional developers and industry figures with long term contributing histories to several lead projects, companies, and communities related to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology

*Difficult to see how it could be more vaguely generalised*
