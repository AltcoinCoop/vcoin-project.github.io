# Teal model characteristics, in detail

Laloux conducted an extensive bottom-up survey of the operational methods and organisational practices of a number of successful commercial organisations. The study identified uniquely-different key features responsible for the organisations’ success (the “secret sauce”, if you like) and it is those features that define the Teal level of organisational model.


> ”There is nothing inherently “better” about being at a higher level of development, just as an adolescent is not “better” than a toddler. However, the fact remains that an adolescent is able to do more, because he or she can think in more sophisticated ways than a toddler.” - *Nick Petrie (Center for Creative Leadership)*


# Three key “breakthroughs” unique to Teal organisations

The whole deal can be wrapped up in three (albeit, very broad) characteristics, also termed “breakthroughs” because they separate the new from the old: 

<div class="ui fluid styled accordion">
  <div class="title">
    <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
    Self-management
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Teal organisations operate more profitably and effectively, even at a large scale, with a system based on peer relationships without the need for either hierarchy or consensus.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="title">
    <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
    Wholeness
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Teal organisations follow practices that invite us to reclaim our inner wholeness and bring all of who we are to work, instead of with a narrow “professional” self / “masculine resolve” etc.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="title">
    <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
    Evolutionary purpose
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Teal organisations are seen as having a life and a sense of direction of their own. Instead of trying to predict and control the future, members of the organization are invited to listen in and understand what the organization wants to become, what purpose it wants to serve.</p>
  </div>
</div>

# A context of broader values

A broader set of values has been associated with organisations that follow the Teal model. The contribution from these values is also a key component of  organisational success. 

> “Because these are early days for Teal, most of the organizational practices you choose will be deeply countercultural. Expect people to question your choices and tell you that your choices are foolish!” - Laloux

# The checklist clearly confirms that V is a Teal organisation

The detailed features ascribed to Teal organisations also act as a handy checklist for comparing them with V.

Although Teal organisations are described as operating “without the need for either hierarchy or consensus”, the Teal model itself makes a basic assumption that a hierarchy already exists. This assumption drives several of the characteristics that have been associated with Teal-level organisations and presents some contradictions. V has no hierarchy and so most (if not all) of these particular assumption-led characteristics are irrelevant and can safely be designated as such.

## By contrast, the [Expanse](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1173722.0) organisational model imposes a hierarchy


### Expanse Development Core
”The Expanse Development Core is composed of the project's founders and core developers. Knowledgeable, talented individuals with  diverse technical experience related to blockchain technology.”

*People are invited to join in the beta effort to test the system and in the launch effort to secure the blockchain but are excluded from ‘founder’ status.*

### Expanse Community Collective
“The Expanse Community Collective is the soul of the project: the people that use it. It is made of the current active expanse token holders. Every one whole expanse counts as a voting share. Holdings less than 1 Exp do not apply.”

*Voting system unspecified. Unstated core assumption: users === holders*

*“Unlike other projects the future of Expanse is chosen by contributors, miners, traders, and those that just want to be a part of and shape the future in a fair and decentralized manner.” --- just as long they hold at least one unit of the coin. Very forward-loooking.*

### Expanse Advisory Board
“A third party board composed of individuals mutually elected by the Developer Core and Community Collective. These should be trusted well known members of the bitcoin/cryptocurrency community with long established reputations in good standing. Ideally, individuals that have a strong technical background and an understanding of blockchain technology, able to make well informed votes on technical and financial issues.”

*Ungrounded, undefined, unworkable: “**should** be”, “trusted”, “well known”, “long established”, “reputation”, “good standing”, “strong technical background”, “well informed”, “technical and financial issues”*

## Expanse Core Team
“The Expanse Team consists of qualified, experienced, professional developers and industry figures with long term contributing histories to several lead projects, companies, and communities related to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology”

*Difficult to see how it could be more vaguely generalised*
