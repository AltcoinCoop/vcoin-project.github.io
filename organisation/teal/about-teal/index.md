# What is a “Teal Organization”?

It is a modernistic organisational model developed by Frédéric Laloux, based on principles of modern systems thinking and laid out in his book [Reinventing Organizations](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/uploads/2/1/9/8/21988088/140305_laloux_reinventing_organizations.pdf). The aim is to create better organizations that can grow and adapt to work in complex environments.

Drawing from Ken Wilber’s [Integral Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_theory_(Ken_Wilber\)) (a model of psychology development that describes human development as following a set course of stages of development) Laloux maps a colour scheme to the historical development of human organizations: Red \> Amber \> Orange \> Green \> Teal \> Turquoise.

And, as ever, the rate of development is accelerating. Teal organisations represent the best integration of what we’ve collectively learned thus far.

Laloux lists three “breakthroughs” of Teal organizations that his fieldwork has identified:

## Teal practices

Each breakthrough is associated with a set of specific practices that embody Teal Organisation principles. 

This is the key point --- these principles are also self-evidently characteristic of altcoin communities, mainly because of the constraints imposed by a crytocurrency implemented as a peer-to-peer network, e.g. in the face of anonymity and decentralisation, self-organising teams are the *only* feasible option. 

### Teal self management practices

* self-organizing teams
* almost no staff functions
* coordination and meetings ad hoc when needs arise
* radically simplified project management
* minimum plans & budgets
* fluid and granular roles
* decision making fully decentralized (advice process)
* transparent real time information sharing incl,. financials
* `coaches w/o P&L responsibility when needed`
* `anybody can spend any amount of money provided advice process is respected`
* `formal multi-step conflict resolution process`
* `focus on Team performance, peer-based process for individual appraisals`
* `self-set salaries with peer calibration, no bonus, profit sharing`


### Teal holistic practices

* `self-decorated warm spaces without status markers`
* clear values translated into explicit ground rules, ongoing values discussion
* `quiet room, meditation practices, team supervision, peer coaching`
* `storytelling practices to support self-disclosure and community building`
* absence of job titles and descriptions to allow selfhood to shape roles
* honest discussion about individual time commitments
* `regular time devoted to address conflicts`
* specific meeting practices keep ego at check
* distributed initiatives taking
* `recruitment interviews by future colleagues, focus on fit with organization`
* personal freedom for training, focus on culture-building
* personal inquiry into one‘s learning journey and calling
* `caring support to turn dismissal into a learning opportunity`


### Teal evolutionary purpose practices

* organization seen as a living entity with its own evolutionary purpose
* strategy emerges organically from collective intelligence of self-managing employees
* decision making by listening to organization‘s purpose (everyone, large group, meditations…)
* concept of competition irrelevant (embraced to pursue purpose)
* growth and market share only important in as much they help achieve purpose
* profit as lagging indicator: will come naturally when doing the right thing
* inside out marketing: offer is defined by purpose
* “sense and respond” planning/budgeting/controlling
* no or radically simplified budgets, no tracking of variance; no targets
* “change management” no longer relevant as organization constantly adapts from within
* suppliers chosen by fit with purpose
* total transparency invites outsiders to make suggestions to better bring about purpose
* conscious sensing of what mood would serve best

The evolutionary purpose practices are a remarkably close description of the characteristics of an Open Source altcoin project. 

In essence, altcoins are *de facto* Teal Organisations created as a natural consequence of the distributed nature of the peer-to-peer network and the decentralisation imposed by the crypto-currency.

Despite the “New Waviness”, the broad-brush description of a Teal Organisation never quite loses sight of its utilitarian purpose: doing things better, more effectively, with a more complex set of values, as appropriate to an ever more complex context.

## Teal organisations are effective

There is no *a priori* reason why the currency component should be the dominant feature of the VCoin project. Potentially, there is much to be gained from exploring the advantages of membership of an advanced organisational model. One approach is to view the currency simply as a means to an end, just one component of a more ambitious effort taking full advantage of the benefit of being a naturally-ocurring Teal organisation.

Hey, it’s a *lot* more substantial than “to the moon”.
