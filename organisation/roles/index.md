# Roles and functions in the VCoin community

There are no roles, there are no functions. There is only a downloadable peer-to-peer cryptocurrency application. and the user/special interest group formed by those who opt to run the app or interact with the blockchain. Within that group, several conceptual divisions can be identified.

## Miners, mining

The application will not function unless blocks are created according to the predetermined schedule, i.e. at least *one* node must be mining and/or processing transactions. SO, there is **mining** and there are **miners**.
