            <h3 class="ui header">Explore the future with VCoin</h3>
            <p>Yeah, the future. It matters, y’know.</p>
            <p>They screwed up the economy, royally. And they’re <em>still</em> at it, still part of the problem. Odds are they’ll screw it up again. And soon.</p>
            <p>Is anything we can do, other than stand idly by? Yes, there is. We can discard the failed models of yesteryear and start looking <em>forward</em>, not back.</p>
            <p>Hence VCoin, an experimental cryptocurrency that has been forged into a working instrument for helping people create a more equitable future for themselves.</p>
            <p>The VCoin Project is an open source, peer-to-peer, pseudonymous, community-driven value transfer system.  <em><strong>It allows individuals to make payments and transfer value without needing to seek permission or evade censorship.</strong></em></p>

              <p>The software that runs the VCoin network is free and open source.  Anyone can review and improve the code.</p>

              <h2 class="ui header">Peer-to-Peer</h2>
              <p>The VCoin network is maintained and validated by the community who uses it.  There is no centrally-controlling bank or corporation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="ui segment">
              <h2 class="ui header">Pseudonymous</h2>
              <p>There is no sign-up or user system in the VCoin network.  Users use cryptography to create keys which control "coins"/VCNs at randomly generated addresses.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="ui segment">

        <h3 class="ui header">Breaking The Grid, Grabs Your Attention</h3>
        <p>Instead of focusing on content creation and hard work, we have learned how to master the art of doing nothing by providing massive amounts of whitespace and generic content that can seem massive, monolithic and worth your attention.</p>

        <h3 class="ui header">Did We Tell You About Our Coin?</h3>
        <p>When we write “Our Coin”, we don’t mean, like, “we the authors”, we mean “all of us”. It’s very specifically, even painfully, inclusive. Why? Because of the network effect, a kind of “virtuous spiral” that comes into effect when people align their interests and work together to solve common problems.</p>
        <p>It’s sort of like the old “united we stand, divided we fall” thing, except that we’re a bit fed up with standing around, so we’re giving things a bit of a gentle push on our own account. Right? Good.</p>
