<p>An interview <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/nick-szabo-if-banks-want-benefits-blockchains-they-must-go-permissionless-1518874">published in the International Business Times</a> of September 8th. 2015.</p>
<p>Take-home point: TBTFs (“too big to fail”) permission requirements inherently weaken the security of the blockchain. Smart contract collateral is either digital or ungrounded.</p>
<blockquote class="ac">
  <p>Legendary cryptographer Nick Szabo says the only way to realise seamless, automated, and global financial integrity is if banks embrace permissionless blockchains, like the system Bitcoin runs on.</p>
  <p>If banks were to embrace permissionless blockchains they could participate as well or better than the newcomers, Szabo told IBTimes UK.</p>
  <p>“But their bureaucracies are so heavily invested in the expertise and importance of local regulations and standards that it‘s extremely difficult for them to cut the Gordian knot and implement seamless global systems.</p>
  <p>“So <span class="lit">they keep trying to re-inject points of control, and thus points of vulnerability, into blockchains</span>, e.g. through ‘permissioning’; <span class="lit">but this nullifies their main benefits, which come from removing points of vulnerability</span>.”</p>
  <p>Szabo reiterated the point: to remove vulnerability banks also have to remove individual human control and the individuals in charge or with root access. Banks naturally hate that loss to their power. But they don’t have any choice if they want to gain the benefits of having an army of independent computers that rigorously, constantly and securely check each others’ work, he said.</p>
  <p>Szabo pointed out that proper financial controls are already somewhat decentralised, thanks to a “human blockchain” of accountants, auditors, etc. checking each others’ work.</p>
  <p>“There are half a dozen or so different entities involved when you do a stock trade on Wall Street, again checking each others' work. You typically see full vulnerability to unaccountable third parties only in pathological situations where naive newcomers try to do money on the centralised web, as with Mt.Gox.</p>
  <p>“But the traditional 'human blockchain' is very labor-intensive and very local — each is based on local regulations and customs and thus splits the world up into mutually untrusting national silos. Permissionless blockchains cut through that like Alexander cutting through the Gordian knot.”</p>
  <h4 class="ui header">Smart contracts</h4>
  <p>Szabo has a deep understanding of the way legal contracts and auditing systems work and has applied computing logic to these areas, famously coining the term “smart contracts” back in the 1990's.</p>
  <p>IBTimes asked Szabo if he expected smart contract execution and other decentralised apps on censorship-resistant systems like Ethereum to challenge financial and legal institutions with a ferocity similar to that of Bitcoin.</p>
  <p>“Yes, eventually moreso, since Ethereum’s more flexible and general language can facilitate a much wider variety of commercial and other formal relationships.</p>
  <p>“However, <span class="lit">the Ethereum community needs to learn to reverse-engineer legal and other traditional patterns instead of trying to re-invent society from scratch</span>. That will take some time to figure out how to do well. It will also take some time for the Ethereum platform to technologically mature, as it has with Bitcoin.”</p>
  <p>“Financial contracts that have clearly-defined rules and can be collateralised are generally viewed as low-hanging fruit within the brave new world of smart contracts. Recently, UBS came out of the bushes with a smart bonds platform built on Ethereum.</p>
  <p>Szabo said bonds are good example of a financial instrument suited to smart contracts because they could be backed by other assets that exist on the blockchain, if the bond issuer itself fails to make a payment.</p>
  <p>“<span class="lit">If it is secured by collateral that can be controlled digitally on or from the blockchain, that will be the most trust-minimised and most automated kind of interaction</span>.</p>
  <p>“These can be performed predominantly by ‘dry code’ (interpreted by computers rather than lawyers) and thus automated and trust-minimised (vulnerability-minimised) for seamless operations across borders.</p>
  <p>“At the other end of the contractual spectrum, <span class="lit">there are a wide variety of contracts where performances are inherently human in nature or where humans have tacit knowledge that isn't readily communicated to software</span>. For example, paying an artist to create a work of art.</p>
  <p>“More prosaically, <span class="lit">most construction contracts involve quality aspects that probably won’t anytime soon be specified well enough for a robot to be able to judge whether the work has been satisfactorily completed. This kind of thing will long remain the domain of ‘wet code’ — traditional law interpreted by lawyers rather than computers."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unless they instruct their corporate lawyers to redefine the meaning of the term “decentralisation” (wouldn’t be the first time), the banks will have a thin time of it, trying to twist the blockchain’s essential defining feature (decentralisation) into some bastardised form of centralised control. They have no choice but to try ...</p>
<p><span class="se">In terms of what banks are looking for from a shared ledger system, it's been well documented that scalability to meet large transaction volumes, legally identifiable and accountable participation based on a permissioned system, and squaring with existing regulatory framework, are deal breakers.</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, one essential characteristic of the cryptocurrencies currently in use is:</p>
<p><span class="se">There is no sign-up or user system in the network. Users use cryptography to create keys which control “coins” at randomly-generated addresses.</span></p>
<p>The “irresistible force” of KYC/AML meets the immovable object of peer-to-peer homogeneity. As Szabo observes above, compromising this homogeneity <em>necessarily</em> entails compromising the security that this very homogeneity brings.</p>
<p>The vested interests will fight to continue their highly profitable dominance which allows them to privatise the profits/socialise the costs and, because they are enslaved by cognitive bias, they will fight hard and dirty with all the methods at their disposal.</p>
<p>Right now, the cognitive bias that persuades them that a fruitful approach is to arrogate open source code for private development is the same one that is preventing them from perceiving the essential disconnect between their “givens” and the reality of peer-to-peer networks. As soon as the penny drops for them that there <em>is</em> no solution that they would find acceptable, then we will see a push for legislation that makes it illegal to use an unregulated cryptocurrency.</p>
