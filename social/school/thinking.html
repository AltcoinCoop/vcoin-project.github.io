title: Decentralised thinking, is there such a thing?
excerpt: We live out our lives under one centralised projection of power or another. The narrative of “fit to govern” is scored for pomp and it is constantly and forcefully celebrated. Can there be such a thing as “decentralised thinking”?

<p>Yes, the notion is a comparatively recent introduction to the discipline.  ...</p>

<h3>Situational cognition</h3>

<p>In his pioneering study of the cultural foundations of cognition, A. R. Luria (1976) distinguished between two broad types of thinking: one concrete, situational and ‘graphic-functional’, the other abstract, categorical and logical. The protocol of a subject called Rakmat, produced as a response to a classification task, is a famous example of the former type.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Subject: Rakmat., age thirty-nine, illiterate peasant from an outlying district; has seldom been in Fergana, never in any other city. He was shown drawings of the following: hammer - saw - log - hatchet.</p>
<p class="a">‘They are all alike. I think all of them have to be here. See, if you’re going to saw, you need
a saw, and if you have to split something you need a hatchet. So they’re all needed
here.’</p>
<p class="n">Employs the principle of ‘necessity’ to group objects in a practical situation.</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p class="q">Which of these things could you call by one word?</p>
<p class="a">‘How's that? If you call all three of them a 'hammer,' that won't be right either.’</p>
<p class="n">Rejects use of general term.</p>
<p class="q">But one fellow picked three things - the hammer, saw, and hatchet - and said they were alike.</p>
<p class="a">‘A saw, a hammer, and a hatchet all have to work together. But the log has to be there, too.’</p>
<p class="n">Reverts to situational thinking.</p>
<p class="q">Why do you think he picked up these three things and not the log?</p>
<p class="a">‘Probably he’s got a lot of firewood, but if we’ll be left without firewood, we won’t be able to do anything.’</p>
<p class="n">Explains selection in strictly practical terms.</p>
<p class="q">True, but a hammer, a saw, and a hatchet are all tools.</p>
<p class="a">‘Yes, but even if we have tools, we still need wood - otherwise, we can’t build anything.’</p>
<p class="n">Persists in situational thinking despite disclosure of categorical term.”</p>
<p>(Luria 1976, 55-56.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Luria's schooled subjects behaved differently. To them, the task of isolating a particular attribute as a basis of categorization seemed “a natural, self-evident procedure” (Luria 1976, 78).</p>

<p>Luria’s conclusions imply that concrete situational thinking is something lower or less developed than abstract categorical thinking. This has prompted Cole and Griffin (1980, 352) to note that the qualitative changes in cognition that Luria sought to demonstrate led him into comparisons “that were distressingly quantitative in their implications”.</p>

<p>Modern interpretations place the conclusions in the context of developmental/educational psychology, preferring a more pragmatic view of the implications as basically an issue of education.</p>


<h3>Foundational theories</h3>

<p>Distributed cognition sits at the intersection of psychology, sociology, and cognitive science. It is essentially the theory that knowledge and the thinking with that knowledge are stretched across the tools, situation, other people, and context. It originated with the work of anthropologist Edwin Hutchins in the 1990s with his studies of navigation on a naval aircraft carrier.</p>

<p>His work on understanding naturally situated cognition led to the conclusion that cognition is socially distributed. Rather than looking for knowledge structures within an individual, his work showed that cognitive activity, or knowing what to do, was a situated process, influenced by other people, tools, and the situation.</p>

<p>Leadership is often studied as something that is done or acted out by an individual. Social or shared leadership approaches often still see leadership as actions done by individuals, just done in cooperation with others. Taking a distributed perspective, in contrast, draws on the theory of distributed cognition to understand leadership is an emergent property of the system. In this way, it sits in between those who see leadership is a result of individual agency and those who see it as an outcome of the situation.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there are two complementary forms of serialization ...</p>

<p>According to Bruner (1986, 12), the paradigmatic or logico-scientific mode of thought attempts to fulfill the ideal of a formal, mathematical system of description and explanation.</p>

<p>It employs categorization or conceptualization and the operations by which categories are established, instantiated, idealized, and related one to the other to form a system. Propositions are extracted from statements in their particular contexts.</p>

<p>The logico-scientific mode deals in general causes, and in their establishment. It makes use of procedures to assure verifiable reference and to test for empirical truth. Its language is regulated by requirements of consistency and noncontradiction.</p>

<p>The narrative type of thought has opposite characteristics.</p>

<p>"The imaginative application of the narrative mode leads instead to good stories, gripping drama, believable (though not necessarily 'true') historical accounts. It deals in human or human-like intention and action (...). It strives to put its timeless miracles into the particulars of experience, and to locate the experience in time and place. (...) The paradigmatic mode, by contrast, seeks to transcend the particular by higher and higher reach for abstraction, and in the end disclaims in principle any explanatory value at all where the particular is concerned." (Bruner 1986, 13.)</p>

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence" title="Collective Intelligence wikipedia entry">Collective Intelligence</a></h3>

<p>Collective intelligence is shared or group intelligence that emerges from the collaboration, collective efforts, and competition of many individuals and appears in consensus decision making.</p>

<img src="/assets/images/graphics/collective-intelligence.jpg" alt="Collective Intelligence graphic"/>
<p style="font-size: 90%; padding: 0.01rem 0">Types of collective intelligence (don’t pay too much attention, it’s bit opaque).</p>

<p>It may involve consensus, social capital and formalisms such as voting systems, social media and other means of quantifying mass activity.</p>

<p>It can be understood as an emergent property from the synergies among:</p>
<ol>
    <li><p>data - information - knowledge</p></li>
    <li><p>software - hardware</p></li>
    <li><p>experts (those with new insights as well as recognized authorities)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>that continually learns from feedback to produce just-in-time knowledge for better decisions than these three elements acting alone.</p>

<p>Or more narrowly as an emergent property between people and ways of processing information.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The term collective intelligence originally encompassed both collective and collaborative intelligence, and many systems manifest attributes of both. Pierre Lévy coined the term "collective intelligence" in his book of that title, first published in French in 1994. Lévy defined “collective intelligence” to encompass both collective and collaborative intelligence: “a form of universally distributed intelligence, constantly enhanced, coordinated in real time, and in the effective mobilization of skills”.</p>
<p>Following publication of Lévy's book, computer scientists adopted the term collective intelligence to denote an application within the more general area to which this term now applies in computer science. Specifically, an application that processes input from a large number of discrete responders to specific, generally quantitative, questions (e.g. what will the price of DRAM be next year?) Algorithms homogenize input, maintaining the traditional anonymity of survey responders to generate better-than-average predictions.</p>
<p>Recent dependency network studies suggest links between collective and collaborative intelligence. Partial correlation-based Dependency Networks, a new class of correlation-based networks, have been shown to uncover hidden relationships between the nodes of the network.</p>
<p>Research by Dror Y. Kenett and his Ph.D. supervisor Eshel Ben-Jacob uncovered hidden information about the underlying structure of the U.S. stock market that was not present in the standard correlation networks, and published their findings in 2010.</p>

<p>But the graphic can be made to work a bit harder for us. Things hang together better if you view the left-hand side as the human component and the right-hand side as the machine component. The middle bit is the fusion of the two and the green shapes are broadly the outputs.</p>

<h3>Collaborative intelligence</h3>
<p>Collaborative intelligence addresses problems where individual expertise, potentially conflicting priorities of stakeholders, and different interpretations of diverse experts are critical for problem-solving. Potential future applications include:</p>
<ul>
<li>competitions, where submissions must be integrated to produce a synergistic outcome;</li>
<li>smart search, where social networks of searchers on related topics co-define search results;</li>
<li>professional groups, interest collectives, citizen science and other communities, where knowledge-sharing is a prerequisite for effective outcomes;</li>
<li>planning, development, and sustainable project management;</li>
<li>smart systems to transform independent cities into collaborative, ecological urban networks</li>
</ul>

<p>A new generation of tools to support collaborative intelligence is poised to evolve from crowdsourcing platforms, recommender systems, and evolutionary computation.</p>
<p>Existing tools to facilitate group problem-solving include collaborative groupware, such as GitHub, Google+, Confluence, eXo Platform, JIRA, Skype, NetMeeting, WebEx, and synchronous conferencing technologies such as instant messaging, online chat and shared white boards, which are complemented by asynchronous messaging like electronic mail, threaded, moderated discussion forums, web logs, and group Wikis.</p>
<p>Managing the Intelligent Enterprise relies on these tools, as well as methods for group member interaction; promotion of creative thinking; group membership feedback; quality control and peer review; and a documented group memory or knowledge base.</p>
<p>As groups work together, they develop a shared memory, which is accessible through the collaborative artifacts created by the group, including meeting minutes, transcripts from threaded discussions, and drawings.</p>
<p>The shared memory (group memory) is also accessible through the memories of group members; current interest focuses on how technology can support and augment the effectiveness of shared past memory and capacity for future problem-solving.</p>
