<h3 class="ui header">Brokers vent anger at FCA over opaque UK lending criteria</h3>
<p>A Financial Conduct Authority mortgage boss has expressed concern after listening to brokers' struggles to meet unpublished and non-transparent lender criteria. <a href="http://www.mortgagesolutions.co.uk/news/brokers-vent-anger-to-fca-on-opaque-lending-criteria/">(link)</a>.</p>
<p>Mortgage policy manager Lynda Blackwell heard brokers’ tales of frustration with often-unpublished lender affordability criteria at The Mortgage and Protection Event 2013. <strong><em>Having apparently strong cases rejected with no explanation is a particular problem.</em></strong></p>
<p>Blackwell stressed the regulator only expected brokers to try to meet lenders’ published ‘headline’ criteria. She said <span style="color:red"><strong><em>the lack of explanation around rejected cases is a concern in terms of broker record-keeping: “We would expect the reason the application didn’t proceed to be on file.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p>Brokers vented their anger at the conference after Blackwell addressed <span style="color:red"><strong><em>the issue of the difference between published headline rates and lenders’ “black box” of internal affordability criteria</em></strong></span> raised by Legal &amp; General housing boss <a href="http://www.mortgagesolutions.co.uk/mortgage-solutions/blog-post/2305067/the-mortgage-market-s-big-unanswered-question-l-g">Stephen Smith in a blog for Mortgage Solutions</a>. Other concerns included the cost to clients if apparently strong applications fail and the impact on broker reputations.</p>
<p>Having forecast the Mortgage Market Review will increase opportunities for brokers earlier in her talk, she commented: “It seems the MMR is putting a spotlight on the way the relationship [between lenders and brokers] is not working very well at all.”</p>
<p>The FCA is listening to broker representatives such as the Association of Mortgage Intermediaries and <span style="color:red"><strong><em>proposals such as date stamping cases in order to monitor criteria changes over time</em></strong></span> and more consistent published lender criteria. Blackwell said she is willing to hear from other broker groups as well.</p>

  <h3>The mortgage market’s big unanswered question…</h3>
  <img src="/assets/images/avatar/stephen.jpg" style="float:left; padding: 0.6rem; margin:0;" alt="Stephen Smith of Legal &amp; General"/>
  <p>Most of the issues that intermediaries are thinking about on MMR come directly from the regulator’s rules. But there is one which sits squarely with the mortgage lenders. And we need an answer on it pretty fast.</p>
  <p>Under MMR, mortgage intermediaries are responsible for ensuring mortgage applications are submitted which meet the ‘lender’s expected affordability criteria’. This term is not defined – so what are we to think? Does it mean simply the criteria by which sourcing systems operate – LTV limits for example?</p>
  <p>Probably not – that is too basic. So does it more likely mean <span style="color:#ff9e04"><strong><em>the criteria of a lender which sit behind the headline product – what income, debt and expenditure requirements there are, whether the product is available to first time buyers, etc?</em></strong></span> If it is this latter, more likely requirement, <span style="color:red"><strong><em>exactly where does an intermediary get this information and how can they prove these were the criteria in place at this exact time on this exact date?</em></strong></span></p>
  <p>At present, an intermediary wishing to have a complete file to be able to demonstrate to the FCA they have chosen the best deal for his client, can take <span style="color:red"><strong><em>a screen shot of the sourcing results. This will show, date and time stamped, where the top products were selected from. A clear, date stamped record, which can be held on file.</em></strong></span></p>
  <p>No such ability exists for ‘lender’s expected affordability criteria’. <span style="color:#FF9E04"><strong><em>Lenders are inconsistent. They publish their criteria in different formats and on different systems – some on the sourcing system notes pages, some on their own websites. There is no industry standard format. Some are short and succinct and some are very long and detailed. Some, very few in our experience, are dated. And the situation is worse where the notes say ‘refer to lender’ – for more complicated affordability issues.</em></strong></span></p>
  <p>So here we are, five months away from MMR day and we do not have the answer to this question.</p>
  <p>There are some further issues stem from this – for example, how will an intermediary record a case where, after discussion, the lender has accepted it, but outside their ‘expected criteria’? What will the lender give the intermediary to show they were happy with this case?</p>
  <p>So, <span style="color:#0BAD14"><strong><em>a plea to the lender fraternity: can you please start talking to each other about this and come up with a simple, industry view and ideally, a standard format for publishing your criteria?</em></strong></span> It’s not much to ask.</p>

<hr/>
<p>We are less than a month into Mortgage Market Review regime and it is therefore logical that there are initial teething troubles.</p>
<p>The one that is really starting to stand out however is the issue of stress testing. It is not stress testing per se that is the issue, it is the fact that so many lenders are withholding the stress test criteria that they are using so that broker do not have a fair representation of what measures the lenders are using.</p>
<p>As a result, when working out affordability for their clients the broker can only base their affordability checks on the published rate, but we know that lenders are using stress tests that vary from +1% to +8% of the published rate.</p>
<p>The consequence for the borrower is that despite meeting all affordability criteria asked for, applications are coming back as declined or for much lower amounts than the borrower has requested.</p>
<p>It hardly meets with the treating customers fairly guidelines to hide criteria on which a loan decision is made, especially if it leads to different lenders carrying out a number of credit checks that could then damage a borrower’s credit rating.</p>
<p>There is also a danger to brokers in the quality metrics stakes; this cloak and dagger approach to stress testing will inevitably lead to more DIPs being declined as brokers do not have full information before placing a client’s application with a lender.</p>
<p>As many lenders base their quality judgements – of both brokers and networks – on the level of DIPs that do not go through to completion, it could reflect negatively on their ratings and ultimately affect the level of proc fees that someone receives.</p>
<p>How can a broker make a qualified decision on where to place their client’s mortgage application if part of the information being used to judge whether the client qualifies is hidden from them? In order to treat both customers and brokers fairly, all stress testing information and criteria should be in the public domain and published on every lender’s website. Without it a broker is advising in the dark without all of the information to do their job.</p>

<p>The day has come and passed, the Mortgage Market Review rules are formally enforceable and the only thing left to do now is knuckle under and get used to them.</p>
<p>Networks and lenders have been carrying out extensive training to get the industry ready for a new era of forensic customer assessments.</p>
<p>They are designed to force borrowers to consider the reality of their spending habits rather than a superficial box ticking exercise of what they would like them to be.</p>
<p>Personal Touch Financial Services invited Mortgage Solutions to one of its broker MMR-training session where Neil Hoare, head of commercial relationships, dissected bank statements as an underwriter would.</p>
<p>While the responsibility for assessing the applicant’s affordability rests with the lender it is better to avoid a frustrating game of ping pong with your underwriter.</p>
<p>In the first of two-part feature PTFS reveals how an underwriter tackles bank statement assessments.</p>

<p>PTFS’ tips on bank statement assessments:</p>
<h2>Regular annual spending</h2>
<p>Be prepared to push customers on their spending over birthdays, holidays and Christmas.</p>
<p>These are permanent expenses which must be be broken down into a monthly spend and included on the application form as if they were saving for the events on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>These are areas of spending where borrowers are often forced to go overdrawn or use a credit card which they cannot afford to pay off.</p>
<p>Holidays fall into this category too. Question applicants on how they will pay for their annual holiday.</p>
<p>Bank statements may reveal travel insurance payments or spending abroad which will throw into question an applicant’s insistence they don’t go on holiday.</p>
<h2>Erratic and frequent cash withdrawals</h2>
<p>A succession of cash withdrawals staggered throughout the same evening, for example on a Friday night, suggest a lack of discipline over spending.</p>
<p>And while this may not be a reason on its own to knock back the mortgage it could be helping to build a picture of erratic or irresponsible spending behaviour.</p>
<p>If the withdrawals cause the applicant’s other bills to bounce it will not bode well for the applicant’s chance of getting approved.</p>
<h2>Vices</h2>
<p>There will probably be space on the application form for tobacco or alcohol spending.</p>
<p>Check what the applicant is telling you against pub debit card payments. Particularly high pub spending one month may be due to a one-off event.</p>
<p>If this is apparent by comparing spending on the other two months then it would be plausible to use an average and explain why. </p>
<p>Gambling is a different story. Payments to gambling outlets will not be viewed positively, particularly if they are frequent.</p>
<p>Do not fall into the trap of thinking any wins will be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Despite your applicant’s insistence they have ‘foolproof system’ your underwriter will not share the same view. Frequent gambling suggests a lack of self-control.</p>
<h2>Unusual or non-descript regular transactions</h2>
<p>Magazine or newspaper subscriptions, lottery payments, hobby memberships, union subs, pet insurance, gym membership and insurance for appliances may not fit neatly into the boxes on an application form.</p>
<p>If it is not completely clear where these payments have been added include a note at the back of the application to clarify where they have been included.</p>
<p>It is important to consider if any of these direct debits have related regular costs associated with them for example pet food if there is pet insurance.</p>
<p>Some direct debits may not be indicative of the product or service they are paying for.</p>
<p>Some gym memberships look like payments for council tax if the gym is run by the local authority. Help the underwriter out by adding a line of clarification.</p>
<p>Paypal payments can be a red herring as they show up as direct debit transaction.</p>
<p>Payments out to another account may indicate the applicant has another account which they have not disclosed to you.</p>
<h2>Informal sources of income</h2>
<p>Is the applicant receiving regular deposits from a source which is not their employment? The source could be a parent.</p>
<p>Check to see if the bank account is being propped up by these deposits which would indicate the applicant is unable to maintain their lifestyle based on their own salary.</p>
<p>The regular transfers may indicate the applicant may have another account they have not disclosed to you.</p>
<h2>Plausibility of outgoings and the inclusion of plausibility statements</h2>
<p>Some lenders are using average spending habits based figures from the Office of National Statistics as plausibility indicators regardless of what figures are entered into the affordability calculator.</p>
<p>Carry out a sense check when your applicant discloses their outgoings. Is a family of five spending £30 a month on electricity realistic?</p>
<p>Where the monthly spend on a particular item is lower than average include a plausibility explanation with the reason why.</p>
<p>Familiarise yourself with the ONS figures – do not use them instead of your applicant’s outgoings but use them as your own plausibility indicator if preferred.</p>

<p>Santander for Intermediaries has tightened its Help to Buy and general affordability criteria while paring back its interest-only policy three months after the launch of the Mortgage Market Review.</p>
<p>Borrowers using the Help to Buy mortgage indemnity guarantee scheme must be using less than four-and-half times their income to support the application.</p>
<p>For all applications, Santander’s online affordability calculator will now display a single maximum loan amount rather than different amounts for low, medium and high credit scores.</p>
<p>To coincide with this change the lender will be updating its Office of National Statistics data which it uses to verify a clients’ stated expenditure.</p>
<p>Applicants taking out an interest-only mortgage will need to have £150,000 equity in their property where the sale of the property is their exit strategy.</p>
<p>In a broker alert the lender said: “As a responsible lender we want to ensure that customers have sufficient equity in their property to enable them to sell and downsize at the end of the mortgage term.”</p>
<p>The maximum age of interest-only or part-and-part borrowers has now been restricted to 65 on maturity of the mortgage.</p>
<p>The maximum mortgage term for the Help to Buy equity loan scheme has been increased from 25 to 35 years.</p>
<p>The maximum loan-to-value for new build flats has been increased from 75% to 80%.</p>
<p>The changes take effect from Friday 25 July this week</p>
<hr/>
<p>Nationwide has increased its stressed rate for all affordability calculations to 6.99% and imposed an income multiple cap of 4.75 times gross income for all employed applications from today.</p>
<p>The building society said it had made the changes following the Financial Policy Committee’s (FPC) guidance.</p>
<p>In June the FPC announced all lenders should apply a stressed rate which assumed a growth in base rate of 3% and placed a restriction on lending above 4.5 times gross income.</p>
<p>It said lenders could hold up to 15% of their new mortgage book on high loan-to-income (LTI) ratios, loans above 4.5 times a borrower’s income.</p>
<p>The rule does not come into force until October 1 but any mortgages written after June 26 will count towards this quota.</p>
<p>But despite the high LTI allowance Nationwide has decided to impose a blanket 4.75 times cap across all employed applications.</p>
<p>The move has caused brokers to question the purpose of the rigourous affordability checks improsed by the Mortgage Market Review (MMR).</p>
<p>Ashley Brown, director of brokerage Moneysprite, said: “The MMR was introduced so lenders could make sensible lending decisions based on individual circumstances with a built in stress test.</p>
<p>“The BoE has decided that because the London property market is running ‘hot’ borrowers in all parts of the country should be restrained with an arbitrary multiple. This must be a regressive step and questions why we all bothered with much of the MMR.”</p>
<p>Brown suggested Nationwide may use its high LTI quota to boost branch network business which he said would disadvantage customers looking for advice from brokers.</p>
<p>Dean Mason, owner of Masons Financial Planning, blamed the regulators for targeting the wrong mechanism to cool down a housing bubble.</p>
<p>He said: “I can’t understand why the powers that be are trying to kerb the perceived ‘housing bubble’ by making it harder for borrowers when the real problem lies with agents over inflating prices, misleading vendors on expectations and intimidating buyers into committing.”</p>
<p>Mason praised Nationwide for being a ‘haven’ for sensible lending decisions where others have missed the point of the MMR.</p>
<p>“A maximum 4.75 times income is still generous compared to most if it is actually prepared to lend to this level where client circumstances allow,” he said.</p>
<p>Brown said he feared the self-employed would be the most affected by the the income cap measures.</p>
<p>“Already they are heavily penalised by affordability calculators and I suspect the new rules will continue and exacerbate this situation.”</p>
<p>But Colin Chapman, director of intermediary firm Genesis, said the restrictions were a positive measure which would not prove to be prohibitive in many cases.</p>
<p>“Whilst the obvious broker view point maybe to be vent frustration at what seems to be another lender retreating to ultra conservative stress testing, the overall impact will not be too troublesome. This is especially true in my local area which isn’t that affluent with very high property prices.</p>
<p>“I think long term the cautious approach is better than the unchecked boom times of the mid 2000s. No one wants a return to the broker dark days of 2008 to 2012.”</p>
<p>Cases where the initial decision in principle was keyed before 5.00pm Monday 21 July will be assessed under current affordability rules.</p>
<p>From Thursday 21 August 2014 any case that requires a reprocess will be assessed under the new affordability calculation.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Following a Mortgage Solutions report on the unintended underwriting fallout of the Mortgage Market Review, appalled brokers flagged yet more outlandish underwriting roadblocks thrown in front of mortgage applicants.</p>
<p>After a Mortgage Solutions question at the FCA’s annual public meeting, CEO Martin Wheatley dismissed lender product and underwriting clamp downs as ‘teething problems’ adding unintended consequences of the new lending rules are being ironed out.</p>
<p>Mortgage advisers rushed to disagree, outlining a rash of illogical lender mortgage decisions.</p>
<p>One broker said after a valuation delay the lender requested an updated pay slip. In the interim the client had a pay rise which the lender ignored, but due to the increased pension payments, the lender cut the mortgage offer by five pounds.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, a lender spotted a regular payment in an applicant’s account for £10 a month to pay a neighbouring child for walking the dog. After the lender’s insistence, the sum was included as a household bill and the mortgage offer was reduced.</p>
<p>Another adviser said: “I had a case of a client on £130,000 per annum and the lender [wanted] a disposable income of over £2,000 per month, which is more than the average wage earner in the UK earns net of tax and before their bills. He was doing a pound for pound remortgage with no debt problems, so [had already] evidenced the fact he lives off a lower disposable income.”</p>
<p>Arron from Temple Capital said: “Most lenders need to revisit their criteria and perhaps gather some brokers together to ensure their criteria is more realistic. The FCA is right to be concerned that unintended consequences have stemmed from isolated compliance departments not being able to see reality.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>The Association of Mortgage Intermediaries (AMI) has been in talks with the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) to feedback broker concerns over how the Mortgage Market Review (MMR) has been implemented.</p>
<p>Robert Sinclair, chief executive of AMI, said: “We have been having discussions about how well the MMR has landed and clearly there have been words around how different lenders have interpreted the affordability requirements.”</p>
<p>Last month Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said in response to a Mortgage Solutions question that it was in talks with lenders which were being ‘too assidious’ in their assessment of a borrower’s affordability.</p>
<p>But Wheatley said it was too strong to say that lenders’ overzealous underwriting of borrowers’ expenditure was an unintended consequence, as brokers had suggested.</p>
<p>He said it was more accurate to refer to it as a ‘teething problem’.</p>
<p>Wheatley brushed off the severity of the issue, which triggered a flood of broker comments to Mortgage Solutions about instances where lenders had nit-picked over trivial expenses causing delays and stress to mortgage customers.</p>
<p>Dominik Lipnicki, director of broker firm Your Mortgage Decisions, wants to see the current fragmented approach joined together.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we have a universal budget planner? A broker will know that as long as they ask certain questions they could be confident that they have covered everything the lender wanted to see. That would make total sense.</p>
<p>“But instead what we have is a totally fragmented market with different ways of looking at things.”</p>
<p>Lipnicki said that while all lenders had different exposures to risk and different niches, some uniformity would help.</p>
<p>But Sinclair said it was these difference which allowed a broker to show their worth to the customer.</p>
<p>“If a customer tried to find their way round this it would be impossible which is why intermediaries exist,” he added.</p>
<p>Steve Smith, AMI board member and mortgage consultant for Springtide Capital, agreed that the complexities and variances of lenders’ approaches to affordability offered brokers an opportunity to attract more clients.</p>
<p>“The range of lender approaches give the broker more value to add to the offering since we typically know what lender to use in which circumstance.”</p>
<p>Smith said if a universal budget planner were introduced it may result in more questions rather than less.</p>
<p>“Can you imagine what it would like? My guess is that it would be a lot longer than most of those being used today,” he said.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the CML said: “Individual approaches by lenders to affordability assessments, in line with FCA rules, are not a matter for the CML.</p>
<p>“However, as the MMR beds down we have fed back in general terms to our members that brokers note there are differences between lenders. It is early days, and it will not be surprising if practices continue to evolve as the new regime beds in.”</p>
<p>AMI plans to meet with the CML later this year to discuss how the market has moved on.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Lenders want an injection of common sense into the Mortgage Market Review (MMR) rules on execution-only sales which they say are causing frustration among borrowers.</p>
<p>Under the new rules if a borrower choses to take out a mortgage without advice using the execution-only route, the lender is not allowed to have any interaction with the customer.</p>
<p>But lenders want the option to give borrowers information to make sure the mortgage they pick for themselves is the most suitable option available.</p>
<p>The frustration was brought to light after the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) opened discussions with lenders to find out what issues have arisen as a consequence of implementing the MMR rules.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the CML said: “In cases where the customer opts for an execution-only sale, lenders have to be sure that the borrower is choosing from a complete and up-to-date list of products.</p>
<p>“If the customer wants to do this on the phone or in a branch, lenders would like to be able to make sure the customer has all the appropriate product information without straying into the advised sales option.”</p>
<p>He said currently, if a new rate has been added to the lender’s website, the adviser can only ask the borrower to revisit the website but cannot say why, which is causing customers to become frustrated.</p>
<p>The CML intends to raise the issue with the Financial Conduct Authority when it begins its review of the MMR and the unintended consequences of its implementation, later this year.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) is concerned that the Mortgage Market Review (MMR) has created an unnecessary barrier for homeowners wishing to switch their mortgage to a cheaper rate.</p>
<p>Borrowers on a Standard Variable Rate who want to apply for new deal on similar terms are being held back by the tough new affordability requirements even if the switch can lower their monthly payments.</p>
<p>In its newsletter, the CML said it was preparing to address the issue with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) when it carries out a thematic review on the unintended consequences of the MMR later this year.</p>
<p>It said: “…we remain concerned about the level of bureaucracy in areas such as product switches.”</p>
<p>Ahead of the FCA’s review the CML has begun talks with members to find out which areas have proved most problematic to implement resulting in unintended consequences.</p>
<p>It emerged that lenders wanted clarity on what checks needed to be carried out if a borrower switches to a new deal and the mortgage balance increases slightly due to administration fees incurred by the switch.</p>
<p>Currently lenders are subjecting borrowers to a full affordability assessment which many are failing to pass.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the CML said that while the MMR was not put in place to create mortgage business it should not create mortgage prisoners asa result of minor loan size changes.</p>
<p>He said it wants the FCA to provide more guidance in this area so lenders have the confidence to simplify the process for borrowers without the fear of falling foul of the rulebook.</p>
