# [Peer-to-peer insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer_insurance)

The aim of peer-to-peer insurance concepts is to make insurance cheaper. For this purpose, a certain number of policyholders pool together. In the event of any claim they support each other financially. If there is no claim, the insurance premiums are reduced.

In today's peer-to-peer models, insurance policyholders form small groups online. A part of the insurance premiums paid flow into a group fund, the other part to the insurer. Minor damages to the insured policyholder are firstly paid out of this group fund. For claims above the deductible limit the regular insurer is called upon. When there is no insurance claim, the policyholder gets his/her share refunded from the group pool or credited towards the next policy year. If the group pool happens to be empty, a special insurance comes into force.

A group can be set up by the policyholders, forming a social network somewhat like Facebook. The only requirement is that all group members must have the same type of insurance. Examples are liability insurance, household contents insurance, legal expenses insurance and electronics insurance. The peer-to-peer insurance concept carries no costs other than the special insurance. The providers are financed through brokerage commissions of insurance companies.

The online peer-to-peer insurance concept was developed by the German Alecto GmbH, Berlin. In 2010, the peer-to-peer-insurance-model was first introduced in the German insurance market under the brand Friendsurance. Large insurance companies such as R + V as well as large investors such as technology investors Horizons Ventures and the European [Regional Development Fund] (ERDF) were also won over for this model.[3][4] The background to the development was the high number of insurance damage claims in Germany. The peer-to-peer approach aims to strengthen the sense of responsibility towards the group while minimizing the number of fraudulent cases.[5]

- In 2011, Friendsurance was awarded the "Service Innovation Award Insurance"[6] and nominated as "Startup of the Year 2011" in a startup competition hosted by online startup magazine "Gründerszene".[5]
- In 2013, about 90 percent of those who took advantage of the peer-to-peer-insurance model were repaid contributions.[6]
- In 2014, the British insurance company Guevara introduced the peer-to-peer insurance concept for car insurance in the UK.[7]
- In 2014, Friendsurance launched the peer-to-peer insurance concept also for existing policies. In cooperation with the insurance company the existing policy will be adapted to enable to use of the concept. Price and service remain unchanged.[8]
- In 2015, PeerCover introduced the peer-to-peer insurance concept in New Zealand.[9]
- In 2015, insPeer introduced the peer-to-peer insurance concept in France.[10]
- In 2015, Peers Mutual Protection (人人互保 Pinyin:renrenhubao） introduced the peer-to-peer insurance concept in China, it publicizes that renrenhubao is not only about peer-to-peer insurance but also establishing a broader mutual protection mechanism.

#### [“Insuring Yourself With A Group Of Friends Has Benefits”](http://www.fastcoexist.com/3032809/insuring-yourself-with-a-group-of-friends-has-benefits)

What's unusual about peer-to-peer insurance is the process becomes transparent. People form small pools among themselves, and because you know your friend, you know a little something more about the risk they present (like whether they're likely to have a car accident). And, you can also affect the outcome. For example, you can reduce your premium by making sure your friend drives safely, or by stopping them from making a claim when they shouldn't.

Insurance is a stodgy, slow moving industry, so peer-to-peer policies aren't widely available yet. But it is an idea that's growing. Last year, we came across Friendsurance, which successfully pioneered the model in Germany. And now there's a new brand from England, called Guevara, which is doing something similar.

When you join Guevara, you either set up a new group and invite in your friends, or you let the company select a group for you. You then pay a premium, which goes towards payouts, and you can vote people out if they're not pulling their weight. The best bit: If there's money left over at the end of the year, it's rolled over, and the price for everyone goes down (Guevara takes a cut, of course, and handles the claims process).

Each group has a message board where members can discuss how to limit costs. For example, you might know a repair shop that has cheap prices for paint jobs, so the group can collectively save money. Guevara claims customers can save up to 80% if nobody in a group makes a claim, though it's still early days. The startup only launched at the end of June.

It will be interesting to see if peer-to-peer insurance takes off in the same way as other categories in the peer-to-peer marketplace have (like, say, Airbnb rentals). Or whether it's just inherently too boring. At least the Marxist revolutionary brand name, after Che Guevara, ought to get some attention.

> “Each month, the bank has a drawing with one $200 winner and four $50 winners. At the end of the year, it will give away a jackpot of $5,000. Customers get one drawing entry for every $25 increase in their account balance. To encourage savings, the bank allows only one withdrawal from a jackpot savings account per month, or else depositors pay a $5 withdrawal fee.”
