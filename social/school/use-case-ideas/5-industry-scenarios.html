<h2>Initial description</h2>

<h3>Blockchain-Powered Applications</h3>
<p>Within circles familiar with Bitcoin, blockchain is known as the foundational infrastructure that supports transactions in the cryptocurrency. However, the capabilities of the blockchain are completely independent of Bitcoin. From a functional standpoint, the blockchain provides the foundation to enable decentralized, secure, and trusted data exchange. By focusing on solving a highly complex problem such as decentralized financial transactions, developers of blockchain technologies have created capabilities that are foundational to many mission-critical applications. From vertical[-specific scenarios like electronic voting or trade settlements to next-generation peer-to-peer messaging applications, the blockchain is definitely an interesting trend in the future of enterprise applications.</p>

<h2>Expansion</h2>

<h3>The blockchain in the Enterprise</h3>
<p>Bitcoin has become one of the most intriguing and revolutionary technologies created in the last few years. From a functional standpoint, the crypto-currency has challenged the most fundamental principles of the world’s financial systems by providing a decentralized, secured and trusted model to process financial transactions. To enable its magic, Bitcoin relies on an architecture powered by a groundbreaking technology known as the Blockchain.</p>
<p>The blockchain is Bitcoin’s public ledger. From a functional standpoint, the blockchain provides a decentralized, time stamped, ordered record of all transactions in a Bitcoin network that can be verified at any time. These simple capabilities represent the first practical answer to profound computer science problems based on the trust of nodes in a decentralized network.</p>

<h3>Adopting the Blockchain in the Enterprise</h3>
<p>Despite its unique value, the process of adopting blockchain solutions in the enterprise is far from easy. Like any other technology trend, the blockchain will have to develop a series of enterprise-ready capabilities to be adopted in business scenarios. The following list includes some of the key capabilities required to adopt the blockchain in mainstream enterprise scenarios.</p>

<h4>Development Platform:</h4>
<p>The blockchain is a very complex architecture modeled in terms of transactional exchanges. In order mitigate that complexity, we need programming frameworks and languages that allow average developers to build general-purpose applications against the blockchain.</p>

<h4>Monitoring Tools:</h4>
<p>To be adopted in enterprise settings, the blockchain community should produce solutions that can actively monitor the health of a blockchain network and recover from unexpected failures.</p>

<h4>Private Cloud Deployments:</h4>
<p>Facilitating the deployment of the blockchain in private cloud topologies using mainstream enterprise infrastructures is a key element to facilitate the wide adoption of blockchain solutions in the enterprise.</p>

<h4>Standards:</h4>
<p>As organizations start adopting blockchain solutions, the need to standards to guarantee the interoperability between different platforms will become more relevant.</p>

<h4>Interoperability with Well-Established Enterprise Platforms:</h4>
<p>Like any other enterprise software trend, blockchain solutions will be required to integrate with established enterprise platforms like databases, line of business systems, etc. Enabling that interoperability will be essential to power the adoption of blockchain solutions in the enterprise.</p>

<h3>5 Industry Scenarios That Can be Disrupted By The Blockchain</h3>
<p>The decentralized, autonomous, trusted and secured capabilities of the blockchain that can redefine of the foundational patterns of enterprise applications. While the principles of the blockchain are well understood patterns in enterprise solutions, until now we have lacked practical implementations that validate its functionality at an enterprise scale. The blockchain opens a new set of opportunities to enterprise scenarios that weren’t possible before. The following list includes some industry scenarios that can drastically improve by the adoption of blockchain technologies.</p>

<h4>Decentralized IOT</h4>
<p>The internet of things (IOT) is becoming one of the most important trends in modern enterprise software. While many IOT platforms are based on a centralized model in which a broker or hub control the interaction between devices, this model has proven to be impractical for many scenarios in which devices need to exchange data between themselves autonomously.</p>
<p>The blockchain provides foundational capabilities of decentralized IOT platforms such as secured and trusted data exchange as well as record keeping. In this type of IOT architectures, the blockchain will serve as the general ledger keeping a trusted record of all the messages exchanged between smart devices in an IOT topology.</p>

<h4>Keyless Signature</h4>
<p>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) has been one of the fundamental technologies powering data signatures. PKI models rely on a central authority to stamp and validate signatures on a data payload.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the blockchain can help to overcome some of the limitations of PKI models with a keyless security infrastructure (KSI). A KSI model uses only hash-function cryptography, allowing verification to rely only on the security of hash-functions and the availability of a public ledger commonly referred to as a blockchain.</p>

<h4>Legal Proof of Existence or Proof of Possession</h4>
<p>Validating the existence or the possession of signed documents is an incredibly relevant element of legal solutions. The challenge of traditional document validation models is that they relied on central authorities for storing and validating the documents which presents some obvious security challenges but also becomes more difficult as the documents become older.</p>
<p>The blockchain provides an alternative model to proof of existence and possession of legal documents. By leveraging the blockchain, a user can simply store the signature and timestamp associated with a document in the blockchain and validate it at any point using the native blockchain mechanisms.</p>

<h4>Security Trade Settlement</h4>
<p>Central Security Depositories (CSDs), has been an essential element of modern equity and bond trading. The centralized nature of CSDs is essential to a successful bond and equity trades. However, the settlement process via CSDs is incredibly expensive and slow, averaging two or three days per trade settlement.  </p>
<p>The blockchain offers an interesting alternative to traditional CSDs as a decentralized ledger that can keep records of transactions without relying on a central authority. The query capabilities of the blockchain will allow the settlement of trades in minutes or even seconds and at a fraction of the cost of the current CSD solutions.</p>

<h4>Anti-Counterfeiting</h4>
<p>Counterfeiting remains as one of the biggest challenges in modern commerce. Segments like luxury goods, pharmaceutical or electronics are constantly affected by counterfeiting. Unfortunately, most solutions in the market require a trust in the third party authority which introduces a logical friction between merchants and consumers.</p>
<p>The decentralized and security capabilities of the blockchain can enable an interesting alternative to traditional anti-counterfeiting platforms. In that sense, we can envision a model in which brands, merchants and marketplaces are part of a blockchain network with nodes storing information to validate the authenticity of specific products. In this model, brands don’t have to trust on a central authority with their product authenticity information and can rely on the security and decentralized trust models of the blockchain.</p>

<p>Additional information</p>
<h4 id="model-information-and-performance">Model Information and Performance</h4>
<p>On one simulation we tested our TA (technical analysis) algorithm with around 30 coins with shared initial parameters over a 3 month period, however many of these coins had little data (small market cap/volume), the results were as followed:</p>
<pre><code>Start capital: $5,000
TA trader: $12,706
Buy and Hold: $-731.79
Random $-1,145
</code></pre>
<p>Buy and hold and random are included as comparisons ie how a portfolio would have performed if one was to ‘buy and hold’ the commodity.</p>
<p>Another model being developed is based on NLP (natural language processing). This relies on input from social media or ‘text data’, such as bitcointalk threads, reddit, twitter etc. The semantical content is analysed and the algo finds patterns between that and price movements.</p>
<p>We are currently working on combining the output from both algos into a deep neural network.</p>
<h4 id="featurecustom-indicator-design">Feature/custom indicator design</h4>
<p>Currently the TA algo utilises the output from TA-lib (a library of 150 technical indicators). The design of custom input parameters (or features as they’re known in machine learning) will allow the models to make better predictions by feeding it more relevant market data. However the priority at the moment is the design of a trading system.</p>
<p>Final words We have 2 PhD’s on our team developing these models. The models collectively have had 6 years of development (3 years/ PhD) and we are now ready to implement them into a trading scenario.</p>

<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>Utilising both linear and non-linear processes, such as deep neural networks and gaussian processes, we have been able to develop various predictive models for use within digital currency markets. This relies on exploiting the inefficiencies found within market data. Furthermore we have been developing models which use text data as an input, this would be data from such mediums as: forums, IRC’s, twitter etc. From extracting the semantic content of said social media the models can find patterns between what is being said the price of a particular market.</p>
<h4 id="technical-analysis">Technical analysis</h4>
<p>The objective of our algorithms is ‘profit maximisation’</p>
<p>The learning algorithm we incorporate evolves continuously over time. This allows it to maintain profitability by adapting to changing market conditions.</p>
<p>Multi task learning is then incorporated to reflect the idiosyncrasies of individual coins. Individual models are built and trained for each ‘coin’, these parameters are then connected to develop a joint model for a collection of or large group of ‘coins’. This allows for any inter market dependences to be recognised and exploited.</p>
<p>On one simulation we tested with around 30 coins with shared initial parameters over a 3 month period, however many of these coins had little data, the results were as followed:</p>
<pre><code>Start capital: $5,000
TA trader: $12,706
Buy and Hold: $-731.79
Random $-1,145
</code></pre>
<p>Buy and hold and random are included as comparisons ie how your portfolio would have performed if you were to ‘buy and hold’ the commodity.</p>
<h4 id="text-analysis">Text Analysis</h4>
<p>There is a distinct lack of sentiment indicators within the crypto currency community.</p>
<p>We are currently developing various models which utilises data from forums, IRC’s, twitter, chat boxes etc. See below for a description of each model.</p>
<h4 id="descriptive-text-analysis">Descriptive text analysis</h4>
<p>Displays trending words within the crypto community</p>
<h4 id="neural-network">Neural Network</h4>
<p>Show words that have had a high impact during a period where the TA module made a prediction, both positive and negative.</p>
<h4 id="activity-forecast">Activity forecast</h4>
<p>Based on historical forum posts this module predicts the future density of threads ie attempts to predict how the popularity of a coin will vary</p>
