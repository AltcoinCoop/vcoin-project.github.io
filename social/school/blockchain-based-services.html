<h3><a href="http://appliedblockchain.com/">Applied Blockchain</a></h3>

<h4>TRUST</h4>
<p>If two or more organizations exchange information that requires a level of trust between them (e.g. transactions, legal contracts), then a distributed blockchain solution allows this to be achieved without the need for a trusted intermediary.</p>

<h4>DATABASE</h4>
<p>Store data in the blockchain using smart contracts. Once stored and confirmed by the blockchain, the data is distributed across the participating nodes, and the fact that the data was stored cannot be refuted. Add permissions to the smart contract, and only specified parties can see, modify or transact with the data.</p>

<h4>WORKFLOW</h4>
<p>Design workflow to run in the blockchain using smart contracts. Allow specific participants to perform tasks in a predetermined sequence. Each activity is distributed to participating blockchain nodes, and recorded in the immutable history of the blockchain.</p>

<h4>END TO END</h4>
<p>We design and build end-to-end smart contract applications that run on private / consortium blockchains. These include using smart contracts to store and share data, as well as running complex workflow. Blockchain applications can be integrated with enterprise applications using standard REST, SOAP, or files. Our solutions integrate web and mobile applications directly with the blockchain.</p>

<h4>AGNOSTIC</h4>
<p>Although we love Ethereum-style smart contracts, we are blockchain agnostic, and develop solutions using a number of different blockchain implementations. We also compare the different platforms' performance and attributes in our lab, and provide impartial advice on the best fit for a project.</p>

<h4>TALLYSTICKS</h4>
<p>Our very own Tallysticks framework enables fast delivery of smart contract applications that can be managed and scaled in an enterprise environment.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.augur.net/">Augur</a></h3>

<h4>Prediction Markets</h4>
<p>Prediction markets allow their users to buy and sell shares in the outcome of an event. The current market price of a share is an estimate of the probability of an event occurring.</p>
<p>If there's a prediction market on whether Hillary Clinton will win the 2016 election, a share of yes that costs 60 cents means she has a 60% chance of winning according to the market.</p>
<p>The Iowa Electronic Market allows its users to wager on the outcomes of U.S. political events. It typically predicts elections within one percent, more accurate than polls or expert opinions. Since 1988 it has correctly predicted the outcome of every U.S. presidential election.</p>


<h4>Why decentralize?</h4>
<p>Historically, prediction markets have fallen short due to dated jurisdictional regulation, lack of volume due to limited payment options, a paltry number of markets, and sometimes even paying out the wrong people!</p>
<p>The root of these problems stems from centralization — an issue solved by blockchain technology. Our prediction markets eliminate counterparty risks, centralized servers, and create a global market by employing cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, ether, and stable cryptocurrencies. All funds are stored in smart contracts, and no one can steal the money. </p>
<p>Augur's interface is currently in English, but we have plans to make it available in other common languages, starting with Chinese and Spanish.</p>

<h4>Demonstration runthrough</h4>
<p>When you load the alpha in your browser you'll see a few things.  </p>
<p>- On the top right is your play money “Cash” in Augur right now, it should say 0.  </p>
<p>- On the left hand side there is a menu along with some information about the Ethereum network.</p>

<h4>Let's get you some money!  </h4>
<p>1. Click on “Account” on the left hand side, then you'll see a few buttons.  </p>
<p>2. Click on “Faucet”, which is next to cash.  </p>
<p>    - Here you can send cash, reputation, and ether.  </p>
<p>    - You'll also notice your “Reputation” and “Ether” balance.  </p>
<p>3. If you want some reputation, click on that faucet button as well.</p>
<p>Now you're ready to create a market or participate in one!  </p>

<h4>Let's participate first:</h4>

<p>1. Click on “Markets” on the left hand side.</p>
<p>2. A bunch of events should load.  </p>
<p>3. Click on one that seems appealing.  </p>
<p>4. Now you can buy shares in an event.  </p>
<p>5. If you think the event is going to happen, buy “yes” shares, otherwise buy “no.”  </p>
<p>6. Input the number of shares you want to buy.  </p>
<p>    - You'll see the current price per share of each outcome; if you buy at, say, 40¢, and you are correct, later on each share you buy will be worth $1.00.  </p>
<p>7. Depending on how many shares you buy, you will be told how much you're moving the odds by purchasing, as well as how much you're purchasing.  </p>
<p>    - If you buy 5 shares, and it costs something like $3, if you're, right you'll get $5 once the market closes, for a profit of $2!</p>
<p>8. Now that you own shares you can sell them if you like.  </p>

<h4>Now, let's make a market!:</h4>

<p>1. Choose “Submit a Market” on the top right</p>
<p>2. Input a description/question you want that market to be on.</p>
<p>    - It should be a yes or no question.  </p>
<p>3. Input how much initial liquidity you want to provide and set a trading fee.  </p>
<p>    - If you provide a lot of liquidity but few people use your market, you'll probably lose some money.  </p>
<p>    - If you provide liquidity and a lot of people use your market, you'll make money off trading fees.  </p>
<p>    - Too little liquidity and people won't trade (due to buying a few shares moving the price a lot). </p>
<p>    - Too much liquidity and you won't make enough money on trading fees to earn a profit.  It's a delicate balance.  </p>
<p>4. Choose an expiration date for your market.  </p>
<p>    - This should be sometime after your event occurs.  </p>
<p>5. Submit it!  </p>
<p>6. After a couple of blocks, your market will be ready for trading.</p>

<h4>Reporting (Ballot in UI):</h4>

<p>To initiate payouts for markets on Augur, we need a way to distribute funds from losers to winners and to determine what the correct outcome is.  To determine the outcome we use reporting.  Holders of our token, “Reputation”, or “REP”, report on the outcomes of events.  </p>
<p>1. To try this out, click on “Reporting” on the left hand side. If there are events that have expired which haven't been reported on yet they'll show up here.</p>
<p>2. For each question, choose either "Yes" (meaning it happened), "No" (meaning it didn't), or "Indeterminate" (meaning you're not sure if it happened or it's impossible to determine if it happened, or the market is unethical.)</p>
<p>3. When you're done, click “Submit Ballot” on the bottom right.  </p>
<p>    - Note that your client has to be on during the ballot reveal period (when the bar at the top is in the second half) for your report to be submitted and counted.  </p>
<p>4. Consensus will be done and we're ready to close the markets whose outcomes have been decided.</p>

<h4>Market Closing:</h4>

<p>1. To close a market (if you created it or wagered in it) go to the “Markets” page.</p>
<p>2. Find the respective market.</p>
<p>3. Click “close.”</p>
<p>     - You will also be able to close markets from the “Accounts” page where it shows your holdings.  </p>
<p>4. Then the market will be closed and payouts will be done.  Congratulations if you participated and won, and better odds next time if you didn't!</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.everledger.io/">everledger</a></h3>

<p>We are a fraud detection system overlaying big data from closed sources like insurers and law enforcement.</p>
<p>Everledger is a permanent ledger for diamond certification &amp; related transaction history. Verification for insurance companies, owners, claimants and law enforcement.</p>
<p>Our technology can be extended to track any asset that carries a unique identifier which is difficult to destroy or replicate.</p>


<h4>What is a smart contract?</h4>

<p>Smart contracts are computer protocols that facilitate, verify and enforce the performance or negotiation of a contract.</p>
<p>Think of a traditional legal contract where there is no need for a third party to enforce the clauses within it. It sounds easy, but this is in fact what makes it 'smart’.</p>
<p>For example, if Alice and Bob sign an agreement stating that the ownership of a digital asset, like a song, is transferred only if a certain amount of money is sent from Alice to Bob within day, and Bob pays in time, a smart contract transfers that ownership automatically without the need for any third party.</p>
<p>A smart contract would also decline the transfer of ownership if Bob does not pay in time.</p>

<h4>What kind of technology do we use?</h4>

<p>For our smart contracts, we combine our private blockchain based on the Eris stack with a public blockchain(Bitcoin) in order to achieve a hybrid model; neither fully public, nor fully private.</p>
<p>We do this in order to get the best of both worlds; high security of a public blockchain, and the complexity and amiability of a smart contract enabled private one. Our smart contracts are also Ethereum ready and will be deployed to it when the Ethereum blockchain moves out of test phase.</p>

<h3><a href="https://followmyvote.com/">FollowMyVote</a></h3>

<p>Follow My Vote has designed the software for an online voting platform, which is both intuitive and easy to use. Users download the voting booth and get their identity verified by a third party for authorization to cast a ballot. The voter submits their vote to the ballot box which is stored securely on a blockchain. In addition, voters can audit their vote to ensure that their voice has been heard.</p>
<p>Follow My Vote began originally as a polling system designed to ensure that elected representatives were truly voting in the interests of their constituents.</p>
<p>However, Follow My Vote soon entered into a joint venture with BitShares; effectively shifting its focus to the development of a verifiable online voting platform secured with the BitShares blockchain technology.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the success of the venture, Follow My Vote moved from their previous location with NuSpark into a shared space in Virginia Tech's Corporate Research Center.</p>
<p>The blockchain is the PKI in our designs. Using a blockchain as a PKI is a practical scenario, and the BitShares blockchain already does just this by mapping usernames to public keys. What this looks like in the voting context is that a user creates a key pair, and publishes the public key on the blockchain as an identity, then uses that key to sign a request for an ID verifier to certify that on-chain identity as being unique and authorized to vote. The exact procedure by which the verifier determines the identity of the person making the request is out of scope for the voting system, but we have a general procedure outlined which closely mirrors that of getting your identity verified for an SSL certificate today.</p>
<p>In order for votes to be considered official votes within our voting system, voters must have their identities verified prior to casting their ballots. Voters can only request official ballots for elections that meet their account credentials (i.e. country of citizenship, age, etc.) and can only request one ballot per election. During the ballot casting process, voters can rest assured knowing that their ballots will not be tampered with, as cryptography technology prevents voters’ ballots from being intercepted and modified prior to being stored in the blockchain-based ballot box. Once a voter’s vote has been stored in the blockchain-based ballot box, it cannot be changed by any other voter within the system. Finally, all voter’s that participate in an election will have an opportunity to audit the ballot box themselves to ensure that the vote count of the ballots stored in the ballot box match the election results being reported.</p>

<h3><a href="http://getgems.org/">Gems</a></h3>

<p>GetGems is a free mobile app available for iOS and Android. It makes instant messaging with friends fun, simple, secure and profitable.</p>
<p>- **Fun.** Keep in touch with friends. Free unlimited instant messaging.</p>
<p>- **Simple.** Your passphrase is your wallet. Fully functional in under 30 seconds.</p>
<p>- **Secure.** Be as anonymous as you desire. Communications are always encrypted.</p>
<p>- **Profitable.** Be rewarded for introducing new users to the network.</p>
<p>Daily airdrop of Gems - Every day, ~27,500 Gems are air dropped from the Exodus Address. The ecosystem automatically distributes these Gems between users according to their relative network contribution. Contribution is measured by the number of active daily users which were introduced by you to the network so far.</p>
<p>Since daily airdrop rewards users who introduce other users, who is rewarded for those who come without a special invitation? Uninvited users will be attributed to random Presale buyers. In addition, air drop share is multiplied by total gems owned. The more Gems you own, the more Gems you make - an advantage to those who accumulate Gems first.</p>
<p>100 million Gems is the total currency supply in the GENESIS BLOCK. Eventual supply is achieved as follows: 50 million Gems distributed to stakeholders; 30 million Gems distributed as daily Airdrop rewards during ~3 years after launch; 12 million Gems reserved for bonus block rewards, promotion, marketing, bounties; 8 million Gems + Presale BTC will fund the network R&D and operation costs.</p>
<p>The Gems currency is powered by Counterparty. Every GetGems user automatically gets his own wallet, protected by the passphrase chosen on registration. The social network username is an alias to the GetGems address, making sending &amp; receiving Gems and bitcoins between users as easy as possible.</p>

<h3><a href="https://monegraph.com/">Monegraph</a></h3>

<h4>What is Monegraph?</h4>
<p>Monegraph is a technology that lets you, in a permanent and public way, claim your work as your own and set its rules for use. Anywhere that work goes, when it is used, you get paid. Built on the oldest and most secure public ledger, Monegraph uses blockchain architecture to establish and link the author of a work to its title of ownership, its constellation of usage rights, and payment terms for handling those rights.</p>

<h4>What types of digital work can be Monegraphed?</h4>
<p>Monegraph was conceptualized by Artist/CEO Kevin McCoy at Rhizome’s Seven on Seven conference in 2014. The initial version supports digital images, photos and animating GIFs. We are working to support many other media types and source file formats in the near future.</p>

<h4>When can I start using Monegraph?</h4>
<p>Beginning July 14, Monegraph is inviting its inaugural group of creators to the platform. Drawn from a range of creative industries spanning art, fashion, photography and design, these pioneers will frame the opportunities that Monegraph brings to their fields. We will be expanding the private beta to a larger user base in August and plans to officially launch to the public in September 2015.</p>
<p>Kevin McCoy: I’m an artist. My artwork is produced in collaboration with my wife Jennifer. For a long time we’ve been doing work that intersects with technology, broadly speaking. I’m also a professor in the art department at NYU. I oversee the digital practices in the art department. In May of last year I presented a concept called Monegraph at Rhizome Seven on Seven at the New Museum and since that time, I have slowly been working to develop it as a platform.</p>
<p>Artist and professor Kevin McCoy's platform Monegraph launches in September. The service offers an online marketplace as well as a licensing system based on similar encryption technology used by Bitcoin and other so-called "cryptocurrencies."</p>

<h3><a href="https://swarm.fund/">Swarm</a></h3>

<p>**What is Swarm basic income?**</p>
<p>Every time a project is created through Swarm, a part of that project is automatically given to all Swarm members. This allows all Swarm members to participate in the distributed abundance made possible by the Swarm.</p>


<p>**How can I create my own DCO?**</p>
<p>Check out this [this guide](https://medium.com/@rubenalexander/f443bc686335) to see how you can create your own DCO.</p>
<p>**Why would I want a DCO?**</p>
<p>Setting up a corporation or non-profit is expensive. DCOs cost nothing to set up. Creating or distributing shares is expensive. With DCOs it is practically free. DCOs allow you to organize bottom up instead of top down and distribute abundance to every member who contributes.</p>
<p>**What is Swarm?**</p>

<h4>Concepts</h4>

<h5>Identity</h5>
<p>Real world identities are represented by a cryptographic key-pair. This key-pair is typically generated by the application on the client device, ensuring that only the client device has possession of the private key. Thingchain offers an in-browser javascript file and a server side nodejs npm package for key generation.</p>
<p>Transactions that transfer ownership on the Thingchain must be signed by the identity key of the individual creating the transaction.</p>
<p>Thingchain maintains a relationship between registered public keys and real world identities.</p>
<h5>Popcode</h5>
<p>A Popcode (Pop == Proof-of-Provenance) is a thing’s unique digital identifier (consisting of a Bitcoin-style private/public key-pair &amp; address) and its associated value, metadata and provenance on the blockchain. For instance, a Popcode may contain 24 bottles or 1 widget or 300 Kgs. The term popcode typically refers to the address.</p>
<p>Popcodes are generated through a secure key derivation function on the thingchain server.</p>
<h5>Tracking</h5>
<p>A thing’s popcode is created, or minted, when user Alice’s identity sends value into the popcode’s public address.</p>
<p>To obtain this value, Alice’s identity address must withdraw it from the thingchain “faucet”, or master address.</p>
<p>When Alice ships the thing to Bob, Bob receives the private key and takes possession of the popcode by sending the value in the popcode address to her identity address. At this stage, the popcode cannot be duplicated and possessed by another user because the address contains no value.</p>
<p>When Bob is ready to ship the thing to Charlie, he releases the popcode by sending the value from his identity address back to the popcode. Charlie is now able to take possession of the popcode and continue the chain of custody.</p>

<h3><a href="http://tradle.io/">Tradle</a></h3>

<p>We help externalize transactions to scale world commerce</p>
<p>- **Why Bitcoin?** blockchain automatically and irreversibly serializes transactions: Human activities will be more transparent, yet more secure, more automatic, yet touching more people, more coordinated, yet more diverse</p>
<p>- **Non-financial transaction** Bitcoin only carries financial transactions: Tradle extends it to securely externalize ANY transactions, like travel, dating or CRM, ERP, B2B. This creates a new extremely simple way to do commerce globally</p>
<p>- **Network Effect** Transactions often have 2 or more participants: When you send transactions to friends and businesses, it gives them more value if they join in, always widening the circle</p>


<p>HOW DOES TRADLE DO IT?</p>
<p>with an inclusive open source project and proprietary business tools</p>
<p>- **Community effort** Tradle community develops crypto log on blockchain:</p>
<p> Open source project with highly compartmentalized data encryption, audited dynamic access allocation, irreversibility, with a choice to be more or less transparent</p>
<p>- **Advantage of existing tools** Not just a REST API, full stack tools: Open source mobile framework combined with the business app dev and integration platform allow Tradle build full-stack sophisticated blockchain apps today</p>
<p>- **Unique app concepts** We invite partners to use our ideas for new types of apps: For the first time in history we are able to connect apps, people and businesses without a trusted company in between. Let's build those apps together.</p>

<p>Privacy-respecting identity &amp; smart contract solutions for enabling credibility, trust and safety</p>

<h4>Next generation multifactor authorization</h4>

<p>Trustatom ID mobile workflow relies on strong cryptography for criticial action authorization.</p>
<p>Unlike in traditional "type this number sequence" schemes (TOTP), user's authorization signature can't be forged, enabling higher level of protection and better audit trail. And yes, no need re-type the numbers in the next 5 seconds!</p>
<p>Trustatom ID authentication is a public service, delivered free of charge. Majority of the workflow happens outside of Trustatom servers and Trustatom has no access to private information.</p>


<h4>Trustworthy identity &amp; credentials</h4>
<p>Knowing who is on the other side of the connection has always been a challenge.</p>
<p>What's even more complicated is knowing sufficiently enough about that person to conduct business with her. With Trustatom ID users can easily share isolated pieces of their information (residency, age, banking information, contacts etc.) signed by trusted third parties upon request.</p>


<h4>Smart Contracts</h4>
<p>Our Contract API are designed to help third party applications to use robust, pre-designed building blocks for different kinds of contracts: document certificates, joint escrows, etc. This API is also seamlessly integrated with Trustatom ID, removing the need to reinvent anything.</p>


<h4>Niche solutions</h4>
<p>Trustatom powers highly tailored solutions for specific industries and niches to maximize the potential of the technology.</p>
<p>The first solution is Streamline.VC, an application that helps investors and companies to establish continuous credibility during the due diligence and post investment.</p>

<h4>Better UX</h4>
<p>Nothing replaces a better, smoother user experience. Trustatom ID technology does not use the traditional approach that requires users to enter a number they see on their phone within a very limited period of time (for example, 30 seconds).</p>
<p>Instead of that, user's phone securely stores a master keypair that is used to sign each and every third party authorization request. The workflow the user is exposed to is very simple. It involves scanning a QR code, and authorizing the app to sign an action-specific, clearly rendered request.</p>

<h4>Secure</h4>

<p>We designed our security scheme to have the right balance of usability and security guarantees. It's a combination of such techniques as: "limited gain" first factor authentication, highly guarded privacy, true off-band communication, use of trusted secure hardware open sourcing our mobile app.</p>
<p>Our scheme allows users to clearly see what kind of authorization they are giving to a third party application and these signatures can't be forged by anybody.</p>
<p>Lastly, but not least importantly, Trustatom ID uses state of art cryptography primitives, such as ECDSA, BIP32, ECIES and SHA256. Our scheme is being reviewed by various experts in the field. Our paper will be soon released to the public.</p>

<h4>Audit Trail</h4>
<p>The very nature of authorizations signed by users allows for granular permission grants that can be irrefutably pinpointed in time, when used in conjunction with Trustatom Smart Contracts API. This allows third party application providers to keep a perfect audit trail of all authorizations forever, ensuring their conformance to their processes and compliance level they are regulated by.</p>

<h4>Trusted credentials</h4>
<p>One of the very important features of Trustatom ID is that it allows third party applications to request relevant pieces of information about the user, without being exposed to all of it (thus violating user's privacy). These chunks of information are provably signed by trusted third parties that Trustatom has partnered with.</p>
