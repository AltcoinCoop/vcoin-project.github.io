<p>A notion that there are certain identity formation strategies which a person may use to adapt to the social world. Cote &amp; Levin 2002 developed a typology which investigated the different manners of behavior that individuals may have. Their typology includes:</p>

<td><b>Personality symptoms</b></td>
<td><b>Social symptoms</b></td>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><i>Refuser</i></td>
<td>Develops cognitive blocks that prevent adoption of adult role-schemas</td>
<td>Engages in childlike behavior</td>
<td>Shows extensive dependency upon others and no meaningful engagement with the community of adults</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>Drifter</i></td>
<td>Possesses greater psychological resources than the Refuser (i.e., intelligence, charisma)</td>
<td>Is apathetic toward application of psychological resources</td>
<td>Has no meaningful engagement with or commitment to adult communities</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>Searcher</i></td>
<td>Has a sense of dissatisfaction due to high personal and social expectations</td>
<td>Shows disdain for imperfections within the community</td>
<td>Interacts to some degree with role-models, but ultimately these relationships are abandoned</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>Guardian</i></td>
<td>Possesses clear personal values and attitudes, but also a deep fear of change</td>
<td>Sense of personal identity is almost exhausted by sense of social identity</td>
<td>Has an extremely rigid sense of social identity and strong identification with adult communities</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>Resolver</i></td>
<td>Consciously desires self-growth</td>
<td>Accepts personal skills and competencies and uses them actively</td>
<td>Is responsive to communities that provide opportunity for self-growth</td>

<p>Kenneth Gergen formulated additional classifications, which include the “strategic manipulator”, the “pastiche personality”, and the “relational self”.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>strategic manipulator</strong> is a person who begins to regard all senses of identity merely as role-playing exercises, and who gradually becomes alienated from his or her social “self”.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>pastiche personality</strong> abandons all aspirations toward a true or “essential” identity, instead viewing social interactions as opportunities to play out, and hence become, the roles they play.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>relational self</strong> is a perspective by which persons abandon all sense of exclusive self, and view all sense of identity in terms of social engagement with others.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For Gergen, these strategies follow one another in phases, and they are linked to the increase in popularity of postmodern culture and the rise of telecommunications technology.</p>
