<p>This story is about darts and inexperience but it starts with gardening.</p>

<p>As a 17 year-old, I managed to get a summer job as a gardener at a local hospital. Pete was the Head Gardener.</p>
<p>The capitalisation is warranted. It may have been an old TB sanatorium in a rural location but that summary trivialises a broader context, as wikipedia notes: “the sanatoria for the middle and upper classes offered excellent care and constant medical attention”</p>

<blockquote>
  <div>
    <p>The Crossley Sanatorium, situated in Delamere Forest in this township, occupies a site of some sixty-six acres, with a south aspect and at an elevation of 480 feet above sea level, and commands magnificent views of the Cheshire plains and distant mountain scenery.</p>
    <p>The Sanatorium, the facade of which is 300 feet long and three storeys in height, was opened on March 31st, 1905, and is available for 100 patients.</p>
    <img style="float:left; padding: 1rem;" src="/assets/images/graphics/crossley-hospital-east-patients-shelters.jpg" />
    <p>The building contains two large recreation or day rooms, a spacious dining hall, used also for entertainments, wards for four or six beds, single bed rooms, bath and douche rooms, and operating theatre, research block, a nurses’ home, and a chapel, in which a Church of England chaplain conducts Divine service on Sundays.</p>
    <p>Attached to the Sanatorium are stables, a laboratory, engine and pump houses, a laundry and kitchens, and to the south of the building, in the grounds, are numerous shelters, some fixed and others revolving; these are provided with lounge chairs, tables and electric light, so that patients can sit out and read in dark evenings.</p>
    <p>The Sanatorium is 3 miles from Mouldsworth station and 3½ from Frodsham.</p></div></blockquote>

<p>Back in the 60s, the hospital needed to employ furnacemen to tend the 1903 vintage coal-fired furnaces that provided heating and hot water for the entire hospital. There’s a fair amount of logistics that underpins the phrase “engine and pump houses”. The furnace room was situated adjacent to the gardeners‘ end room in the brick-built ground floor layer under an old TB ward, one of the many separate hospital buildings.</p>

<p>The ward was sited on the shoulder of a small slope and gave a magnificently uninterrupted view of the sweep of the Cheshire plain right out to the horizon and Moel Famau 50 miles away to the south. Standing in one of the open doorways, one could easily see, and anticipate, bad weather closing in.</p>

<p>I had the priviledge (as I realized later) of knowing two of the furnacemen, Ray and Vinky. To use the euphemism of the times, both were “displaced persons”. Estonians, I was given to understand, no further details were offered. Both were strapping blokes, a desirable attribute when tasked with shovelling coal into and coke out of, metre-wide furnaces.</p>

<p>Those furnaces were the real 1903 McCoy; a brick furnace with a semi-circular arched brick face about a metre and a half across/high, with a pair of non-nonsense smallish metal doors, head-high heaps of glistening coal, that kind of business.</p>

<p>Vinky was quiet almost to point of shyness, reminded one of Yul Brynner but with a classical wide-shouldered tapering physique whereas Ray was just big all round in a Brian Blessed sort of way. Ray loved the view out over the plain and the way the storm fronts rolled in, he would stand in the doorway and boomingly announce the weather to the listening world: “Tunner ‘n’ lightnin. Yes. Tunner ‘n’ lightnin.”</p>

<p><img class="ui centered massive image" src="/assets/images/graphics/tunner-n-lightnin.jpg" alt="a view over a hedgerow and shallow grassy valley opening on to a wide plain and a distant line of hills."/></p>

<p>Vinky was locally famous for his surgically sharp sheath knives that he forged from old car springs heated in the furnace. He had a pukka blacksmith’s anvil usually stored in a corner of the furnace room. When actually forging, Vinky would place the anvil on a flat section of tree trunk as a base.</p>

<p>Once, Pete dared me to try lifting the anvil. We all trooped next door to the furnace room where Vinky was working on the anvil. Pete explained that I was to try lifting the anvil. “Ja, ja” said Vinky, smiling warmly as he stepped aside.</p>

<p>Anvils are an awkward shape for lifting, I discovered. And it was at that point that I really, <em>really</em> understood the concept of “density”. I could grasp the damn thing but just didn’t have anywhere near enough wrist strength to maintain a grip. After much heaving and straining (it <em>looked</em> small enough to lift), I shame-facedly admitted defeat.</p>

<p>A couple of days later I couldn’t resist sneaking into the furnace room and trying again. I discovered that if I wrapped my arms round it, I could just about lift it off its log base. I reported my success and invited confirmation. Everone dutifully assembled and, with great effort, I lifted the anvil, managed to stagger a few steps and set it, rather heavily, down on the floor. There were broad smiles all round and I felt richly satisfied and then ... Pete nodded to Vinky who stepped over to the anvil, casually lifted it off the floor, strolled across the room and replaced it gently on its base. I thanked him for his co-operation and we departed, me being profoundly struck by the sheer difference in capability.</p>

<p>I was even more impressed a few weeks later when Vinky offered to make me one of his infamously sharp “car spring” sheath knifes, so sharp you can shave with it (as I later proved to myself). And to top it all, Vinky showed me how to keep it razor sharp using a leather strop. Classic stuff.</p>

<p>So yes, there were gardens that needed professional tending and the gardeners also tended the orchards and beds that added fresh fruit and vegetables to the hospital’s menu. I learned to “dub” a hedge (Cheshire dialect for “clip”), how to drive an Allen (motorised) scythe and, from “Owd Tommy”, who came in from retirement for a couple of days to help out with mowing the orchard in the traditional manner, how to sharpen and use a wooden-handled, 5'7" tall scythe.</p>

<img style="float:left; padding: 1rem;" src="/assets/images/graphics/allen-scythe.jpg" description="http://www.oldlawnmowerclub.co.uk/mowers/moms/mp014-allen-scythe" alt="a man cutting long grass with an Allen scythe"/>

<p>It’s the exposed tree roots, you see --- they might be called exposed but they’re actually hidden in the long grass. The tines of the Allen scythe fork just jam straight into them and before you’ve time to react, the powerful torque has dug the wheels into the ground and viciously slewed the scythe round, pivoting on the jammed tines, wheels churning, gouging huge rents in the earth. Nah, ’s got to be done proper, like.</p>

<p>So, a brilliantly sunny day, four blokes (Pete, Sam, Owd Tommy, Young Graham), each with a whetstone and a scythe (a head-high one, <em>just</em> like the one the Grim Reaper’s got), went to mow the grass in an orchard. It is of course essential to the narrative that Old Tommy was able to keep up a steady, apparently effortless pace whereas Young Graham tired rapidly, falling further and further behind. And you will be gratified to learn that indeed was the case. In spades, much to the amusement of Pete and Sam. Owd Tommy just grinned wryly.</p>

<p>So now you have some idea of the social context, you may even have seen some of the old Ealing comedies from the early 60s, it’s an affectionate and not entirely ungrounded view.</p>

<p>And so to darts.</p>

<p>The gardeners’ “cabin” (as it was known) was an end room in the brick-built ground floor of an old TB ward building. The ground sloped sharply down from front to back and it was basement at the front, ground level at the back, handy for access. The cabin had a dartboard, Pete and Sam would enjoy a game or two after the packed lunches had been consumed and the table cleared away. I fancied myself at darts and vied with Pete and Sam.</p>

<p>One day, Pete observed that I was improving. And suggested a small wager, to give me an incentive to improve further. After a slight hesitation, I agreed. We’d just been paid (a traditional brown paper wage packet containing notes and coins).</p>
<p>Needless to say, in fairly short order I was fleeced, losing all my wages to Pete, who was unflinchingly stern about me honouring the wager and insisted I hand over my wage packet.</p>
<p>“Unless ...”, said Pete</p>
<p>“Yes?” said I, in sudden hope.</p>
<p>“You can have your wages back if ... one, you promise <em>never</em> to play darts for money ever again and two, go next door and ask Vinky to show you how to play darts.”</p>
<p>Hugely relieved, I took the offer, earnestly assuring Pete that I never, ever would*. And, mystified, I went next door to explain to Vinky that Pete was holding my wages hostage until he, Vinky, showed me how to play darts.</p>
<p>“Ohhh, ja. Sure.” said Vinky and accompanied me back to the gardeners’ cabin. Pete handed Vinky the darts which his hand almost completely enfolded, just a bit of point and a wisp of flight showing. Standing at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oche">oche</a>, Vinky asked me to choose what he should aim for.</p>
<p>“Double 20?” I ventured.</p>
<p>"Ho, ja." He leaned out over the oche and just flicked the dart at the board ... &lt;thunk&gt; into the middle of the double 20.</p>
<p>Not quite sure of what I was seeing, I said “Er, treble 20?”</p>
<p>"Sure." &lt;thunk&gt; straight into the treble.</p>
<p>I realised I had been done up like a kipper and the right thing to do was to follow the narrative. “Bull?” I said.</p>
<p>“Sure, ja.” &lt;thunk&gt;, an inner bull, of course.</p>
<p>Stunned, I could only blurt out “But why don’t you play for the hospital darts team?”</p>
<p>“Ohhh ’s too boring” he said, waving his hand to brush away the very suggestion and with that airy dismissal, returned to his smithing.</p>
<p>“There,” said Pete, handing me back my wages. “You’d never have guessed that in a million years, would you? <em>That’s</em> why <em>you</em> should never play darts for money. Right?”</p>
<p>“Right.” I said and I never have(*). I was dimly aware at the time that I’d been the recipient of something a bit special and breaking the promise would spoil the story.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>So, how does any of that play into VCoin?</h3>

<p>Well, you know a bit more about me for a start and some of the influences that still affect me today. That adds some context to the other writing and allows nuances to emerge, broadening the bandwidth.</p>

<p>Objectively, the story is rose-tinted. I very much doubt they would have recalled it as fondly as I, if at all. Gardening can be pleasant as a hobby but it is a different proposition as a job, day in, day out, year in, year out, in all weathers, not getting any easier. And if anyone reading this thought they recognised Owd Tom from Sam Vimes’ description, you’re not alone.</p>

<p>Back then, </p>

<p>But times change. The job of furnace tender no longer exists. Ray and Vinky were the last, their role rendered superfluous by advances in energy technology. Hospital gardeners have been replaced by NHS Environmental Services, which has apparently been outsourced to a global corporation with a monomania for scrubby bushes. The hospital itself fell into disuse in the 1990s, the notion of a sanatorium has no place in modern healthcare.</p>
