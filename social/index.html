            <div>
              <p>Welcome to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivist_anarchism" title="wikepedia entry for Collectivist anarchism">anarcho-collectivism</a>. It’s not as daft a label as it might seem. Read on ...</p>
              <blockquote class="ac"><p><em>Collectivist anarchism advocates the abolition of both the state and private ownership of the means of production. It instead <span class="lit">envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves</span>. For the collectivization of the means of production, it was originally envisaged that workers will revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production. Once collectivization takes place, <span class="lit">money would be abolished to be replaced with labour notes and workers' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations based on job difficulty and the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market</span>.</em></p></blockquote>
              <p>There has been a revolution, but in personal computing. There’s more than a hint of the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves, especially when it comes to cryptocurrency.</p>
              <p>Irrespective of how we got here, I’d argue that we’ve now arrived at something very much like anacho-collectivism --- the end result described above bears a remarkable resemblance to the notion of “smart contracts” and some altcoins’ plans to cast the blockchain as employer, making payment in altcoin.</p>
              <p>So welcome to anarcho-collectivism, I hope it works for you.</p>

        <p>No, really ...</p>
        <blockquote><p>“A second type of simple sabotage requires no destructive tools whatsoever and produces physical damage, if any, by highly indirect means. It is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a noncooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow suit. Making a faulty decision may be simply a matter of placing tools in one spot instead of another. A non-cooperative attitude may involve nothing more than creating an unpleasant situation among one’s fellow workers, engaging in bickerings, or displaying surliness and stupidity.”</p>

        <h4>Organizations and Conferences</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Insist on doing everything through “channels.” Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions.</li>
            <li>Make “speeches.” Talk as frequently as possible and at great length. Illustrate your “points” by long anecdotes and accounts of personal experiences.</li>
            <li>When possible, refer all matters to committees, for “further study and consideration.” Attempt to make the committee as large as possible — never less than five.</li>
            <li>Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.</li>
            <li>Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions.</li>
            <li>Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to re-open the question of the advisability of that decision.</li>
            <li>Advocate “caution.” Be “reasonable” and urge your fellow-conferees to be “reasonable” and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.</li>
          </ul>
        <h4>Managers</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>In making work assignments, always sign out the unimportant jobs first. See that important jobs are assigned to inefficient workers.</li>
            <li>Insist on perfect work in relatively unimportant products; send back for refinishing those which have the least flaw.</li>
            <li>To lower morale and with it, production, be pleasant to inefficient workers; give them undeserved promotions.</li>
            <li>Hold conferences when there is more critical work to be done.</li>
            <li>Multiply the procedures and clearances involved in issuing instructions, pay checks, and so on. See that three people have to approve everything where one would do.</li>
          </ul>

        <h4>Employees</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Work slowly.</li>
            <li>Contrive as many interruptions to your work as you can.</li>
            <li>Do your work poorly and blame it on bad tools, machinery, or equipment. Complain that these things are preventing you from doing your job right.</li>
            <li>Never pass on your skill and experience to a new or less skillful worker.</li>

        </h4>
        <h3 class="ui header">Study says toxic coworkers undercut groups in destructive, expensive ways</h3>
        <p>“According to economist Dylan Minor, writing in a Harvard Business School paper, toxic workers are so damaging to the bottom line that avoiding them or rooting them out delivers twice the value to a company that hiring a superstar performer does.” Read more at: <a href="http://phys.org/news/2015-12-toxic-coworkers-undercut-groups-destructive.html" title="Full article on phys.org">http://phys.org/news/2015-12-toxic-coworkers-undercut-groups-destructive.html</a></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
          Analyzing rarely available employment data on nearly 60,000 workers across 11 companies, the study focused on only the most egregious kinds of toxic behavior: conduct that resulted in a worker's termination. The data suggests that toxic people drive other employees to leave an organization faster and more frequently, which generates huge turnover and training costs, and they diminish the productivity of everyone around them.
          </p>

          <p>Although not part of the study, Minor said client customer surveys indicate that toxic workers “absolutely” tend to damage a firm’s customer service reputation, which has a long-term financial impact that can be difficult to quantify, he said.</p>

          <p>Who is most likely to be a toxic worker? The research shows three key predictors.</p>

          <p>First, whether a person has a very high level of “self-regard” or selfishness. Because if such people don’t care about others, they’re not going to worry about how their behavior or attitude affects co-workers.</p>

          <p>Second, feeling overconfident, which can lead to undue risk-taking. “Imagine you’re going to engage in some misconduct and steal something from your company. If you think the chance that you’re going to get away with it is much greater than it really is, … you’re more likely to engage in that conduct,” said Minor.</p>

          <p>And lastly, if a person states emphatically that the rules should always be followed no matter what, watch out.</p>

          <p>“That is kind of counterintuitive. In a simple world, we would just ask someone, ‘Do you always follow the rules?’ And if you do, then of course, you’re not going to ever break them. But I find very strong evidence in my study that those that say ‘Oh no, you should always follow the rules’—versus those that say ‘Sometimes you have to break the rules to do a good job’—that the people who say ‘I never break the rules’ are much more likely to be terminated for breaking the rules,” said Minor.</p>

          <p>Getting rid of toxic workers is often difficult because they‘re also more likely to be high performers, or to be perceived as such, which can blunt or blind supervisors to the true depth of their impact on the workplace.</p>

        <p>“The danger when we operate wholly in a world of representations and images is that we begin to mistake that world for reality, and to believe that by manipulating symbols we can automatically change the reality they represent. We lose touch with the reality behind the symbols. Grisly death becomes collateral damage. Torture becomes enhanced interrogation. A bill to relax pollution controls becomes the Clear Skies Act. Defeat in Iraq becomes victory. War becomes peace. Hate becomes love.
