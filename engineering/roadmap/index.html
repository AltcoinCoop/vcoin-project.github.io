            <h3 class="ui header">Brokers vent anger at FCA over opaque UK lending criteria</h3>
            <p>A Financial Conduct Authority mortgage boss has expressed concern after listening to brokers' struggles to meet unpublished and non-transparent lender criteria. <a href="http://www.mortgagesolutions.co.uk/news/brokers-vent-anger-to-fca-on-opaque-lending-criteria/">(link)</a>.</p>
            <p>Mortgage policy manager Lynda Blackwell heard brokers’ tales of frustration with often-unpublished lender affordability criteria at The Mortgage and Protection Event 2013. <strong><em>Having apparently strong cases rejected with no explanation is a particular problem.</em></strong></p>
            <p>Blackwell stressed the regulator only expected brokers to try to meet lenders’ published ‘headline’ criteria. She said <span style="color:red"><strong><em>the lack of explanation around rejected cases is a concern in terms of broker record-keeping: “We would expect the reason the application didn’t proceed to be on file.”</em></strong></span></p>
            <p>Brokers vented their anger at the conference after Blackwell addressed <span style="color:red"><strong><em>the issue of the difference between published headline rates and lenders’ “black box” of internal affordability criteria</em></strong></span> raised by Legal &amp; General housing boss <a href="http://www.mortgagesolutions.co.uk/mortgage-solutions/blog-post/2305067/the-mortgage-market-s-big-unanswered-question-l-g">Stephen Smith in a blog for Mortgage Solutions</a>. Other concerns included the cost to clients if apparently strong applications fail and the impact on broker reputations.</p>
            <p>Having forecast the Mortgage Market Review will increase opportunities for brokers earlier in her talk, she commented: “It seems the MMR is putting a spotlight on the way the relationship [between lenders and brokers] is not working very well at all.”</p>
            <p>The FCA is listening to broker representatives such as the Association of Mortgage Intermediaries and <span style="color:red"><strong><em>proposals such as date stamping cases in order to monitor criteria changes over time</em></strong></span> and more consistent published lender criteria. Blackwell said she is willing to hear from other broker groups as well.</p>
            <p><em>Domain-specific opportunity</em> ^^^^</p>
            <h3 class="ui header">Referenced blog post</h3>
            <blockquote style="font-size:90%; color: #666">
              <p>Most of the issues that intermediaries are thinking about on MMR come directly from the regulator’s rules. But there is one which sits squarely with the mortgage lenders. And we need an answer on it pretty fast.</p>
              <p>Under MMR, mortgage intermediaries are responsible for ensuring mortgage applications are submitted which meet the ‘lender’s expected affordability criteria’. This term is not defined – so what are we to think? Does it mean simply the criteria by which sourcing systems operate – LTV limits for example?</p>
              <p>Probably not – that is too basic. So does it more likely mean <span style="color:#ff9e04"><strong><em>the criteria of a lender which sit behind the headline product – what income, debt and expenditure requirements there are, whether the product is available to first time buyers, etc?</em></strong></span> If it is this latter, more likely requirement, <span style="color:red"><strong><em>exactly where does an intermediary get this information and how can they prove these were the criteria in place at this exact time on this exact date?</em></strong></span></p>
              <p>At present, an intermediary wishing to have a complete file to be able to demonstrate to the FCA they have chosen the best deal for his client, can take <span style="color:red"><strong><em>a screen shot of the sourcing results. This will show, date and time stamped, where the top products were selected from. A clear, date stamped record, which can be held on file.</em></strong></span></p>
              <p>No such ability exists for ‘lender’s expected affordability criteria’. <span style="color:#FF9E04"><strong><em>Lenders are inconsistent. They publish their criteria in different formats and on different systems – some on the sourcing system notes pages, some on their own websites. There is no industry standard format. Some are short and succinct and some are very long and detailed. Some, very few in our experience, are dated. And the situation is worse where the notes say ‘refer to lender’ – for more complicated affordability issues.</em></strong></span></p>
              <p>So here we are, five months away from MMR day and we do not have the answer to this question.</p>
              <p>There are some further issues stem from this – for example, how will an intermediary record a case where, after discussion, the lender has accepted it, but outside their ‘expected criteria’? What will the lender give the intermediary to show they were happy with this case?</p>
              <p>So, <span style="color:#0BAD14"><strong><em>a plea to the lender fraternity: can you please start talking to each other about this and come up with a simple, industry view and ideally, a standard format for publishing your criteria?</em></strong></span> It’s not much to ask.</p>
