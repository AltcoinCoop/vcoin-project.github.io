            <p>Yeah, the future. It matters, y’know.</p>
            <p>They screwed it up royally. But they’re still here, still part of the problem. Odds are they’ll screw it up again. And soon.</p>
            <p>Is anything we can do, other than stand idly by? Yes, there is. We can discard the failed models of yesteryear and start looking <em>forward</em>, not back.</p>
            <p>Hence VCoin, an experimental cryptocurrency that has been forged into a working instrument for helping people create a more equitable future for themselves.</p>

            <p>Yes that's right, you thought it was the stuff of dreams, but even bananas can be bioengineered.</p>

        <p>Instead of focusing on content creation and hard work, we have learned how to master the art of doing nothing by providing massive amounts of whitespace and generic content that can seem massive, monolithic and worth your attention.</p>

        <h3 class="ui header">Did We Tell You About Our Coin?</h3>
        <p>When we write “Our Coin”, we don’t mean, like, “we the authors”, we mean “all of us”. It’s very specifically, even painfully, inclusive. Why? Because of the network effect, a kind of “virtuous spiral” that comes into effect when people align their interests and work together to solve common problems.</p>
        <p>It’s sort of like the old “united we stand, divided we fall” thing, except that we’re a bit fed up with standing around, so we’re giving things a bit of a gentle push on our own account. Right? Good.</p>
