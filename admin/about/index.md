#About the VCoin project
The VCoin project is an open source, peer-to-peer, pseudonymous, community-driven value transfer system (a crypto-currency). It allows individuals to make payments and transfer value without needing to seek permission or evade censorship.

It’s a community project and so relies for its continued existence on the principle of self-interested contribution. 

## How does it work?
The value transfer services provided by the cryptocurrency have a market value: the cost of achieving the same value transfer via the centralised commercial banking system.

As part of an essential balance of interests, the network imposes modest and proportionately-scaled fees on transfers in order to provide recompense those who devote compute power to processing everyone’s transactions, thus ensuring that the coin and network function as designed.

## Why does it work?
To be successful in the long run, an altcoin community must achieve a balance of conflicting interests.

Merchants and spenders generate fees but they are very vulnerable to price instability and exchange rate fluctuations. However, change is the lifeblood of liquidity-bringing day traders who facilitate the back and forth flow of transactions.

Players with an eye to the longer term care little for velocity other than as an indicator of stability, their main interest is in scarcity and in growing the value of their holdings. Their gradual accumulation of coins puts a floor under the market, providing a degree of stability that supports merchants’ and spenders’ activities.

Ideally, miners would be homogenous; anyone and everyone should be able to easily take an active role in supporting the network by contributing to the collective computing power necessary to process transactions and maintain the integrity of the public ledger.

Achieving a balance is crucial for the continued functioning of the coin. Imbalances cause the coin to become an inefficient instrument. The more accentuated the imbalance, the worse the performance of the instrument. As a predictable consequence, interest diminishes to naught.

#VCoin’s origin

VCoin was [announced to the cryptocointalk forum](https://cryptocointalk.com/topic/38482-ann-vcoin-sha256-pow/) on 13th May 2015. The OP’s profile reads “Country:Japan”, make of that what you will.

Bitcointalk subscriber [chrisvl](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=361013) re-posted the details to [bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1059746.0). A week or two later the OP’s activity ceased.

Subsequent support and development has been in the form of *ad hoc* contributions made independently by various interested Bitcointalk subscribers.

The OP’s Github repository has been forked, development now proceeds in several further forks on Github. The majority of people seem to consider [https://github.com/vcoin-project](https://github.com/vcoin-project) to hold some authority.
