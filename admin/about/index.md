#About the VCoin project
The VCoin project is an open source, peer-to-peer, pseudonymous, community-driven value transfer system (a crypto-currency). It allows individuals to make payments and transfer value without needing to seek permission or evade censorship.

It’s a community project and so relies for its continued existence on the principle of self-interested contribution.

#VCoin’s origin

VCoin was [announced to the cryptocointalk forum](https://cryptocointalk.com/topic/38482-ann-vcoin-sha256-pow/) on 13th May 2015. The OP’s profile reads “Country:Japan”, make of that what you will.

Bitcointalk subscriber [chrisvl](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=361013) re-posted the details to [bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1059746.0). A week or two later the OP’s activity ceased.

Subsequent support and development has been in the form of *ad hoc* contributions made independently by various interested Bitcointalk subscribers.

The original Github repository has since been forked and development now proceeds in several different forks on Github, [including this one](https://github.com/vcoin-project).

#the V construct, an emergent collective intelligence

V is an emergent collective intelligence. At first glance that might seem a bit far-fetched but we are talking about *a cryptocurrency*.

The emergence of a collective intelligence is almost unique in altcoins because the vital sense of collective identity is usually prevented from blossoming by the distorting undue influence of the developer.

All I am doing is pointing to a strong correspondence between the description of a Teal organisation and the description of a peer-to-peer networked cryptocurrency. I provide full sources. Same goes for the argument that V is a “collective intelligence”.

You can make up your own mind how plausible you find the argument --- you can even do your own further research on the nuts and bolts. If you do gain some insights, then please share them.
