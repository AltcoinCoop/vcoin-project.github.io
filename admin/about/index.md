#About the VCoin project
The VCoin project is an open source, peer-to-peer, pseudonymous, community-driven value transfer system (a crypto-currency). It allows individuals to make payments and transfer value without needing to seek permission or evade censorship.

It’s a community project and so relies for its continued existence on the principle of self-interested contribution.

#VCoin’s origin

VCoin was [announced to the cryptocointalk forum](https://cryptocointalk.com/topic/38482-ann-vcoin-sha256-pow/) on 13th May 2015. The OP’s profile reads “Country:Japan”, make of that what you will.

Bitcointalk subscriber [chrisvl](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=361013) re-posted the details to [bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1059746.0). A week or two later the OP’s activity ceased.

Subsequent support and development has been in the form of *ad hoc* contributions made independently by various interested Bitcointalk subscribers.

The OP’s Github repository has been forked, development now proceeds in several further forks on Github. The majority of people seem to consider [https://github.com/vcoin-project](https://github.com/vcoin-project) to hold some authority.
