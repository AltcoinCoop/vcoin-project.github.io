#Welcome to the VCoin community!

The VCoin Project is an open source, peer-to-peer, pseudonymous, community-driven value transfer system.  It allows individuals to make payments and transfer value without permission or censorship.

---

##Open Source

The software that runs the VCoin network is free and open source.  Anyone can review and improve the code.

---

##Peer-to-Peer

The VCoin network is maintained and validated by the community who uses it.  There is no centrally-controlling bank or corporation.

---

##Pseudonymous

There is no sign-up or user system in the VCoin network.  Users use cryptography to create keys which control "coins"/VCNs at randomly generated addresses.

---

##Community Driven

VCoin exists only through the contribution and support of the community.
